HyperMate G is about the size of a credit card and has buttons and a screen. These help the user to verify and confirm transactions. The wallet can connect via Bluetooth.

\([Unboxing video featuring the product.](https://tbm-auth.alicdn.com/e99361edd833010b/JigtJkBfR5TWOuRWJJB/ict5sRLBnWoCGDpGqCp_268558942153_hd_hq.mp4?auth_key=1637901597-0-0-33bbbc34f296640fa8afdd65d93ce9be)\)

  
## Private keys can be created offline and are not shared
 
> HyperMate wallet will NOT enable Bluetooth or USB connection before the wallet initialization process is completed in order to guarantee that the initialization process is completely conducted in an offline environment.
 
After setting up the hardware wallet, you can create a wallet and set a PIN. Afterwards, you are provided with the 12/24-word mnemonic.
 
## Device displays receive address for confirmation
 
 The official [help center](https://hyperpayhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409741620495-RECEIVE-PAYMENTS) states that this is possible. 
 
 > Receiving payments can be done offline without connecting your HyperMate mobile application. Press “up” and “OK” together to enter the menu and select “My Address” and mainnet to find your receive address, and you can press “down” to display the QR code of your address.
 
 It also shows [a picture](https://hyperpayhelp.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4409734271759/mceclip0.jpg) of the receive address on this wallet's screen.
 
## Reproducibility
 
 We found a [Github repository](https://github.com/hyperpayorg/hardwallet) called "Hyperpay Wallet HardWallet"
 
 As a result, this product is now slated **for verification.**
