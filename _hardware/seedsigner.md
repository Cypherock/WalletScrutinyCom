The Seed Signer is a truly Open Source project that lowers the barrier for entry for airgapped multi-signature cryptocurrency hardware wallets. The code is publicly available as are the instructions for assembly. 

It claims to [solve the following problems](https://seedsigner.com/faqs/):

> - Creates a secure, air-gapped environment for private key generation
> - Enforces strict separation between private key storage and protocol software / internet
> - Lowers the barrier cost of multi-sig security (from several hundred to < $50)

## Can the private keys be created offline? 

Yes. The seed signer is airgapped.

## Are the private keys shared? 

No. The companion apps only get signed transactions and no keys.

## Does the device display the receive address for confirmation?

Yes. 

## Does the interface have a display screen and buttons which allows the user to confirm transaction details?

Yes. 

## Is it reproducible?

This product requires further verification.
