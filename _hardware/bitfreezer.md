Its website is [no longer online](https://bitfreezer.app/). The accompanying Android app on Google Play is also [no longer available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitfreezer.app.wallet). We were also not able to locate links to its public source code.

## Setup Procedures

> Install the app by searching “Bitfreezer” in the app store or request beta access through this website. Then follow the instructions.
>
> Click “register” to set-up your account, be ready to provide a memorable username and password.
>
> Now that you are registered, you can create multiple cold wallets for your cryptocurrencies. Follow the instructions within the app.
>
> With every cold wallet generated, you will receive a key. It is vital that you store this key offline. In the event you should ever need to recover your wallet, this key will be the only way this is possible.
>
> Conduct transactions from the wallets on your smartphone. Simply follow the instructions to connect keys and to send/receive funds.

## Verdict

All indications point to a discontinued product. 

Moreover, the promotional material shows no screen or buttons, so this product at best was blindly signing whatever an app asked it to sign.
