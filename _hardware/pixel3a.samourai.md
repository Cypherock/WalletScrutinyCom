## Background 

An unconventional approach to "refit" **used** Google Pixel 3A's into hardware wallets culminated in this effort. It was initially described in an article on BitcoinMagazine ["HOW TO ESTABLISH MOBILE BITCOIN PRIVACY WITH A PIXEL 4A AND CALYXOS"](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-establish-mobile-bitcoin-privacy-with-a-pixel-4a-and-calyxos).

Graphene OS and CalyxOS are both mobile OS's with emphasis on security and privacy. 

The actual wallets include: 
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.samourai.wallet' verdict='true' %} 
- Monerujo - a Monero client

## Product Description 

> All Software has been verified with cryptographic signatures and Shasums from the OS to the Apps installed.
>
> The device has NOT been connected to the internet after the OS installation, wallet apps (and wallpapers) have been side loaded via USB and all verified twice.
>
> - Monero or Bitcoin accepted
- shipment available
- Any customer data will be destroyed.

## Analysis 

This device can be classified as DIY as users are simply provided with a custom Pixel 3A. 

Trust is on the table as buyers would have to trust the maker or the provider not to include any surreptitious code. Though they may claim that *"All software has been verified with cryptographic signatures and Shasums from the OS to the Apps installed"*, users should know well to verify on their own. 

The real value for devices like this is in providing the buyer with a proof-of-concept that it could actually be done.
