## Product Description 

From [the online stores:](https://www.stakebox.org/collections/real-crypto/products/bitcoin-holographic-coin)

> We bring to you our very first limited edition Bitcoin collector coin. This is a holographic cold storage wallet, allowing you to secure your digital Bitcoin and hold it in physical form.

and:

> Our holographic coins are cold storage wallets. This means you can store your private keys behind the hologram and it showcases your public key so you can receive crypto on your new cold storage wallet. We include detailed instructions that make it easy to put these together, as well as videos on our media page showing a visual step-by-step process of how to create your secure wallet and apply it to the coin.

## Analysis 

From the [website's disclaimer:](https://realcrypto.org/hologram-how-tos/bitcoin-how-to/)

> If someone gets a hold of your coin and takes off the hologram, they own your private keys to this wallet. Real Crypto has no liability for your lost, stolen or hacked private keys. These instructions are here to help you stay safe but we make no guarantee that this will prevent hackers from obtaining your private keys. By making a cold storage wallet on a computer and printer that has or will ever be connected to the internet, you must accept a level of risk that your private keys could be compromised. 

The keys may not be prefilled as you're meant to print them yourself but once somebody steals the coin and removes the sticker, there's not much in the way of them stealing your funds altogether.

On another paragraph:

> You don’t have to put your private keys on the coin. You can take your QR Code deposit address from your ledger nano s, Trezor, Coinbase account or even an exchange and put it on your coin. There is a recessed area on the coin and the hologram will have an air pocket behind it if you don’t have at least one piece of paper behind the hologram. Cut that paper to .37’x.37″ or 9x9mm so it fits correctly in the hologram window. This allows you to still accept crypto from your friends to your other wallet

The design may look nice, but when it comes to security, a coin with a sticker is **not practical to use as a bitcoin wallet.**

As the online stores selling this product say that it is now out of stock, it appears that {{ page.title }} is **discontinued or defunct.**
