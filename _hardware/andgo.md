## Verdict

The ANDGO bitcoin hardware wallet isn't currently available in the market. We [reached out to them via twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485890405921337344) to ask them about their product but didn't get a reply in weeks. Until new information is made available we assume this product is not released yet.
