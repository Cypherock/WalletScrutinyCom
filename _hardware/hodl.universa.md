## Background 

On February 26, 2018, a Medium article announced the {{ page.title }} hardware wallet was available for pre-order. It claimed the device could support Bitcoin, ERC20 compatible tokens, and Universa tokens. It was meant to connect to the user's phone via Bluetooth and had an OLED display for confirming transactions.

Checking the links to the pre-order reveals that the website is down, however, [this applies to the site their page is hosted on.](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/icobacker.com.html)

## Analysis 

Universa's Twitter account has seen activity in 2021, but there was nothing relating to this wallet. The provider's current website does not feature any store or page for {{ page.title }}

As information is scarce and outdated, we have to assume that this product is abandoned or defunct. As such, it qualifies as **vaporware.**
