## üìÑ Link to [Official Documentation](https://docs.bithd.com/en/latest/)

## Private keys can be created offline - ‚úîÔ∏è

Prior to creating a wallet and thus generating the seed, the [device must first be paired with the bitpie app](https://docs.bithd.com/en/latest/bithd/initialize.html#id3). 

After creating a BitHD account, the wallet can then be created.

## Private keys are not shared - ‚úîÔ∏è

- Unauthorized physical access to wallet protected by PIN
- Password account ‚Äì (protect private key leak)
- No private keys leak risk in case of theft

## Device displays receive address for confirmation - ‚úîÔ∏è

The device display is [big enough to show the address](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1464200501650542594) prior to transaction confirmation.

## Interface - ‚úîÔ∏è

The watch has a [0.96 inch display](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5104019.0)

## Reproducibility - ‚úîÔ∏è

BitHD has a page called related reports that links to a Medium blog post entitled "[How to Verify BitHD Wallet Firmware Source Code?](https://medium.com/bitpie/how-to-verify-bithd-wallet-firmware-source-code-b9128dc30e64)"

Upon checking the [GitHub page of BitHD](https://github.com/bithd?tab=repositories), we find that it has several elements that have been forked from Trezor. 

This is for verification.
