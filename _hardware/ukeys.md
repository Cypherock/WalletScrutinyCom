In a Medium article from 2018, {{ page.title }} [describes itself as a biometric hardware wallet company.](https://medium.com/@UnikeysTeam/we-are-unikeys-the-world-firsts-biometric-hardware-wallet-company-in-cryptocurrency-6563e7dcc73a)

We checked the Twitter account for any information concerning this hardware wallet or the company behind it. The account has not been active since early 2020.

There aren't many sources about this wallet's functions and it's unclear if it even is still available for purchase. Due to the associated website being down and the lack of recent activity on any social media, we have to assume that {{ page.title }} is currently **defunct.**
