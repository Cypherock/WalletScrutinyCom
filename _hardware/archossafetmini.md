The shop has a country picker to choose between France (default), Germany and
UK. The product is shown as discontinued for Germany and UK.

The device has screen and buttons for transaction verification:

> Every transaction is displayed on the screen and must be physically approved
  using hardware buttons.

On the provider website there is no claim about being open source but there is
[this repository](https://github.com/archos-safe-t/safe-t-mcu) according to
which {{ page.title }} is a clone of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/trezorOne' verdict='true' %} but
with no updates in three years.

[Their Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ARCHOS) also has no activity since
two years - with 13k followers.

There is more activity on
[their Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/ArchosOfficial) but not
regarding the {{ page.title }}. At least not the last two years.

As we are not sure if the GitHub account is even theirs, we
[asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WalletScrutiny/status/1427064999663570944)
for clarification.
