## verdict

The promised date of **"late 2016/early 2017"** is now almost 5 years. We [reached out to Jaxx](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485819187222450178) via twitter to ask them whether the project is still ongoing. Until further notice, this project will retain its last known status.
