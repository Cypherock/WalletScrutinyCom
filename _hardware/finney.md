## Notes

Searching for more information concerning this "cryptophone," we found a review from an Amazon Customer:

  ★☆☆☆☆ September 18, 2021 <br>
  Do not buy this phone.<br>
  The custom Sirin OS hasn't been updated in 2 years and is still running off of an old android branch.<br />
  The wallet (the big selling feature!) can not receive transfers, and appears to be completely offline.<br />
  The dCenter app is also offline, so you only have access to the play store.<br />
  Everything they are selling this phone on is no longer supported, and that is not shared anywhere in any of the information about this phone.

The Youtube channel is inactive, with [the latest video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXFGO81xjH4) upload date being on June 28, 2019. 

This wallet appears to have not been updated for two years. We will classify this wallet as **stale.**
