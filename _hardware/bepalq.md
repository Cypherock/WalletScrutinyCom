Launched 3 years ago, the website now displays "Website is under maintenance" and "Actively cooperate with the latest industry regulatory policies". 

Screenshot [taken and posted on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1464189901348356099).

With no shop links, increased regulatory scrutiny in China and a non-functioning website, it is safe to assume that this wallet is no longer in the market.
