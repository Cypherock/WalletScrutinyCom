FuzeW refers to itself as a "wireless cryptocurrency hardware wallet."  It resembles a credit card, although it has both a screen and buttons.

We cannot find any public source code. It appears that this product is **not verifiable.**

Notably, according to the firmware release notes, FuzeW has last received a new update on 27th Jan 2019. This makes it **obsolete** by our definition.
