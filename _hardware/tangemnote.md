## Product Description 

[Security Details](https://shop.tangem.com/pages/faq-security-and-technical-details)

> A Tangem Card is a highly secure hardware cold wallet made to store any kind of digital assets / cryptocurrency / Bitcoin on blockchain technology. With an NFC-enabled phone, you can verify your balance and extract your assets if you want to move them to another wallet.

Transactions and verifications are carried out via an [Android companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangem.wallet). The app must be installed through a phone that supports NFC.

A video tutorial on how to setup the Tangem could be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST4jvcaE_UU).

With the Tangem card, a user can: 

> - Check the validity of the Card and the assets it’s holding. 
> - Show the assets blockchain address.
> - Extract (send) funds to other Tangem Cards or blockchain wallets.
> - Pay with the Card (with merchants currently accepting crypto).

The private key is stored on the secure EAL6+ chip. Tangem also [claims](https://shop.tangem.com/products/tangem-note) that their firmware is audited by Kudelski Security

## Analysis 

Like most cryptocurrency cards that use NFC, the Tangem relies on a companion app. They claim that transactions are truly hand-to-hand as the Tangem is meant to be physically passed on from one person to another. Relying on a companion app, the receiver must have an NFC enabled Android phone with the Tangem app installed. One of the Tangem's disadvantages is the **lack of an input or output interface** that could confirm a transaction independent from a companion app.
