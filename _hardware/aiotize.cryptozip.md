## Background 

The device has a stark resemblance with the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/seedsigner' verdict='true' %}. 

The components are generally similar save for the USB plug. 

They claim to be Open Source but we were not able to locate a repository. 

## Analysis 

Absent links to a repository, detailed specification sheet, functions, or even a description of how it works, we believe this to be a copy of a **do-it-yourself project**.
