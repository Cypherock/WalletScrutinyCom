Very little can be found about this hardware device, the only reference to this wallet can be a purchase link on [Amazom](https://www.amazon.ca/Littleshell-Cryptocurrency-Hardware-Wallet-ERC20-tokens/dp/B07KPT79RN)

This listing has the wallet first available on Nov. 21 2018, currently it is unavailable. I would conclude this is defunct.
