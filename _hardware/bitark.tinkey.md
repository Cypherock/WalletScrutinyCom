## Analysis 

The {{ page.title }} is associated with the bitark.io exchange. This is evident in the cross-promotion between BitArk and Tinkey in its tweets and instagram accounts. Most of the activity from these accounts occured in 2018. The current bitark.io website does not refer to tinkey or to the exchange. The [last Medium post](https://medium.com/@bitark/bitark-weekly-028-october-8-october-13-59df5522345c) of BitArk dated October 13, 2018, was specifying KYC procedures for its users. 

We believe that this device has been discontinued a few months after its launch in the 2nd quarter of 2018. Its last tweet was dated October 25, 2018. Its last Instagram post was made in October 13, 2018. 

A [picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoQyVQOAQA3/) of the device does not show a display interface.

In some of its social media posts, we can see that it can be acquired by donating some ETH. Nevertheless, since the shop on its homepage is no longer available, it is safe to assume that the device is **no longer in production**. The url "https://tinkey.io" has not been archived in archive.org.
