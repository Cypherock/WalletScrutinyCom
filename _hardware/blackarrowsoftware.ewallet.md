**⚠️ Note:** There are multiple serious allegations on Blackarrow Software's available social media accounts including Facebook and bitcointalk.  

[A Reddit post from r/Bitcoin in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ygong/ewallet_trezor_compatible_hardware_wallet_just/) stated that eWallet was "just released."

It's presumed that Black Arrow Software, the company providing this product, is no longer active. The official website is down and the Twitter account hasn't seen any activity since 2017.

Here is [an archived version of the product's page.](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116164822/http://www.blackarrowsoftware.com/store/ewallet.html) From the description:

> This is a hardware wallet designed to protect your Bitcoins.
>
> eWallet is a lot better than a paper wallet, better than banking security. It effectively provides best protection in the industry. It produces a paper wallet for backup that can be used to restore your coins should the device fail or get lost.

Below are the advertised features:

> - 100% Trezor compatible, can be updated from mytrezor.com with the latest firmware.  
> - Truly wearable: it does not require a cable to connect to your laptop and smaller than Trezor.
> - Open source code
> - Can be safely used on a infected computer even with a keylogger installed
> - This wallet never exposes the private keys to the outside world to keep your coins always safe.
> - All transactions are signed by the wallet.
> - Embedded screen ensures that you sign the transaction that you really intend to.

## Verdict

The company has a [seriously extensive history](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=105804) when it comes to the bitcoin community. There were allegations that Black Arrow Software merely [copied the Trezor firmware](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=983471.msg10825751#msg10825751) and altered the bootloader and the license.  

With the site down and the company's social media inactive, we have to assume that this product is now **defunct.** We also have to consider the allegations pertaining to the products similarity at least in code to Trezor, as well as the string of allegations against it to mark it as **fake**.
