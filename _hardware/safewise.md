we could not find much information anywhere about this device, except that [Safewise is from Coinwise](https://twitter.com/coinwisebr/status/1137068094319484929)(Brazil). They seem to have [given away some prototypes](https://twitter.com/coinwisebr/status/1070031333928378369) but that was in 2018.

On their website, clicking on 'buy' redirects to the homepage whilst showing a message saying "Detecting Devices".

We [reached out to them via twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1484841599377211392) which has become inactive since late 2019. Until further information is made available, we do not believe this product reached market.
