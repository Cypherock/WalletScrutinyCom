The idea of physical coins that contain bitcoins was the brainchild of Mike Caldwell, a software engineer from Utah. The coins come in different BTC denominations: 1, 10, 25, 100 and 1000. The physical bitcoins grew in popularity because of their tangible nature. They were first announced in the bitcointalk.org forum on [September 6, 2011.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41892.msg509883#msg509883). Embedded in each physical coin is a 30-character string representing the private key. This was covered by a tamper-resistant hologram.

Caldwell has since stopped selling the coins on November 27, 2013 due to [FinCen notices and other regulatory concerns](https://www.reuters.com/article/bitcoin-letters-idUSL2N0JW1YP20131217). However, it is still possible to track how many casascius coins in circulation have not been redeemed via this [website](https://casascius.uberbills.com/).
