Some [third-party blogs](https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/06/06/sirin-v3-rebadged-samsung-galaxy-s21-military-grade-security-features/) have pointed out that Sirin V3 is based off the Samsung S21 but with a heftier price tag, but no notable hardware differences save for some "enhanced military-grade security features" and "pre-installed apps". It is based off the [Samsung Knox mobile security platform](https://pr.reblonde.com/sirinlabs-v3/).

Also in its retinue of features:

- Restricts apps installation with white/black list apps policy.

- Disallow keyboard replacement.
- Disallow Download-Mode on boot.

- Encrypted storage on boot.
- Restricts Factory-Reset, Safe-Mode.
- Controls all mobile capabilities.
- Applies policy groups remotely.
- Manages multiple devices instantly. 

It's also worth noting that [Sirin Labs held an ICO](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2285838.0) for its FINNEY phone. It also has its own token (SRN).

The Co-CEO of Sirin Labs, Moshe Hogeg, [has been subject to a number of lawsuits](https://www.timesofisrael.com/3-of-israels-most-hyped-initial-coin-offerings-were-scams-ex-employees-allege/) alleging fraud from the ICOs that he reportedly launched.

## Is this phone a "blockchain phone" or a "hardware wallet"?

It is possible to whitelist any cryptocurrency wallet on the platform - including third party apps. However, the Sirin V3 does not contain any references to "blockchain", "cryptocurrencies" or "bitcoin". 

We were not able to find any mention of this in their [FAQ](https://shop.sirinlabs.com/pages/sirin-v3-faq)

This product does not have the inherent functions of a Bitcoin wallet, but Sirin Labs' {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/finney' verdict='true' %} does.
