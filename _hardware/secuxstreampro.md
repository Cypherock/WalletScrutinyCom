The {{ page.title }} is manufactured by the same company as {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxstonew20' verdict=0 %}. On [its homepage](https://secuxtech.com/secux-payment-terminal), it is described as the "Worldâ€™s first Bluetooth LE payment crypto payment solution."

StreamPro has not appeared in SecuX's official store and has hardly any relevant results compared to other SecuX products. It's unclear whether this product has been released or if it is available for purchase.

> 01 Merchant Authorization <br />
Upon entering the correct amount at cashier, SecuX StreamPro enables crypto payment by generating a scannable one-time QR code.
>
> 02 Customer Confirmation <br />
> Customer confirms and processes payment with biometric authentication such as fingerprint or facial recognition.

Here is a description for this product:

> Merchant Dashboard puts you in charge and stay on the top as a business manager and team leader. It offers a comprehensive understanding of analytic information such as payment history, account information, sales data, and statistics.

While it claimed to be a "crypto payment solution" we assume it is not intended to be used as a true hardware wallet.
