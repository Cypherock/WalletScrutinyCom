## Background

Nemanja Nikodijević is a security researcher who has managed to create an Open Source hardware wallet called hwallet that uses significantly less lines of code. 

He elaborates in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgF5klTcD8).

The hwallet is not commercially available and is a DIY bitcoin hardware wallet. He built the project in order to prove that there is a simpler and safer way to build bitcoin hardware wallets compared to current commercially available solutions.

## Wallet Description 

From his [repository](https://gitlab.com/nemanjan/hwallet), the required components are:

- FRDM-K82F or FRDM-KL82Z
- Pmod OLED 

## Analysis 

As an Open Source DIY project, it is **not available commercially**. However, researchers might want to verify the reproducibility of the code but it would only be for a device they themselves have built according to Nikodijević's specifications. It is more prudent to do so once it has been released.
