## Product Description

This Monero wallet hardware wallet is still a work in progress. There are no indications that it supports bitcoin as well. We [reached out to the provider Ivan Ahepjuk](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1505780601869434881) to confirm. Until such time that we can confirm, we'll treat the wallet as non-bitcoin.
