message: >
  The app provider also shares code but we could so far not verify that the
  published code matches the published app!
explanation : >
  This verdict means that the provider did share some source code but that we
  could not verify that this source code matches the released app. This might
  be due to the source not building deterministically or due to the
  provided instructions on how to compile the app not being sufficient or
  due to the provider excluding parts from the public source code. In any
  case, the result is a discrepancy between the app we can create and the app
  we can find on the app store and any discrepancy might leak your backup to the
  server on purpose or by accident.
  
  
  As we cannot verify that the source provided is the source the app was
  compiled from, this category is only slightly better than **closed source**
  but for now we have hope projects come around and fix verifiability issues.
question: Is the published app matching the published code?
details: >
  Published code doesn't help much if it is not what the published app was
  built from. At this point we try to reproduce the app. We

  1. obtain the app from the platform

  1. compile the app from the published source code using the published build
     instructions
  1. compare the two apps

  1. we might spend some time working around
     [issues that are easy to work around](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/110237303)

  If this fails, we might search if other revisions match or if we can
  deduct the source of the mismatch but generally consider it on the provider to
  provide the correct source code and build instructions to reproduce the build,
  so we usually open a ticket in their code repository and
  classify the wallet as
