question: Is it a wallet?
details: >
  If it's called "wallet" but is actually only a portfolio tracker, we don't look
  any deeper, assuming it is not meant to control funds. What has no funds, can't
  lose your coins. *It might still leak your financial history!*
  
  
  If you can "have" bitcoins in it but not actually receive or send them, then
  what really happens is that you can get exposure to the Bitcoin exchange rate
  but we still don't consider it a wallet.
