  We could not find this to be an app meant to store, receive and send
  coins.
explanation : >
  This appears to not be an app to send and receive bitcoins. We will
  probably remove this app from the project.
question: Is it a wallet?
details: >
  If it's called "wallet" but is actually only a portfolio tracker, we don't look
  any deeper, assuming it is not meant to control funds. What has no funds, can't
  lose your coins. *It might still leak your financial history!*
