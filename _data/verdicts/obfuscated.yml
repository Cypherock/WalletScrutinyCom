title: 'Obfuscated'
short: 'Obfuscated'
color: '#d33100'
redflag: true
message: >
  The app's binary contains active obfuscation which makes it
  significantly harder to analyze what it is doing.
explanation : >
  This verdict means that the app could not be decompiled meaningfully.
  In benign cases code symbols are replaced by short strings to make the app
  smaller but for the sake of transparency this should not be done for 
  non-reproducible Bitcoin wallets. (Reproducible wallets could obfuscate the
  app for size improvements as the reproducibility would assure the
  auditability.)
question: Is the decompiled app auditable?
details: >
  Some providers claim to publish their source code but absent
  reproducibility, it is impossible to verify if the code published has
  anything to do with the app offered for download.
  
  
  Especially in the above cases, obfuscation is a huge red flag. If the code
  is public, why obfuscate it?
  
  
  As obfuscation is such a red flag when looking for transparency, we do also
  sometimes inspect the binaries of closed source apps.
  
  
  As looking for code obfuscation is a more involved task, we do not inspect
  all closed source apps but if we see other red flags, we might use this test
  to get clarity abuot putting the app into this red-flag category.
