message: We encountered a build error while compiling from source code!
question: Is the compiled source code free from build errors?
details: >
  Published code doesn't help much if the app fails to compile.

  Many apps don't have diffoscope / diff recursive brief output as the app failed 
  to compile altogether.  
  
  
  Listing the apps fitting this description in a seperate category entirely
  may increase the chances of developers fixing the build issues as they are more
  visible.
