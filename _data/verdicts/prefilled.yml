  It's a known fact that the device gets delivered with the private keys as
  defined by the provider.
explanation : >
  The device is delivered with the private keys. This means the provider had
  direct access to those keys and as there is no way of prooving he deleted
  them, this system relies on trust and cannot be verified.
question: Are the keys hidden from the provider?
details: >
  The best hardware wallet cannot guarantee that the provider deleted the
  keys if the private keys were put onto the device by im in the first place.
  
  
  There is no way of knowing if the provider took a copy in the process. If he
  did, all funds controlled by those devices are potentially under the control
  of the provider and could be move out of the client's control at any time at
  the provider's discretion.
