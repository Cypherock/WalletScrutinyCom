title: 'Custodial: The provider holds the coins'
short: Custodial!
color: '#d33100'
redflag: true
message: >
  As the provider of this app holds the users coins, verifiability of the
  app is not relevant to the security of the funds!
explanation : >
  This verdict means that the app might or might not publish source code and maybe
  it is even possible to reproduce the build from the source code but as it is
  custodial, the provider already has exclusive control over the funds, so it
  is not a wallet where you would be in sole control of your funds.
  
  
  Custodial wallets might not be the worst option for all users.
  
  * Do your own research if the provider is trust-worthy.
  
  * Do you know at least enough about them so you can sue them when you have to?
  
  * Is the provider under a jurisdiction that will allow them to release your funds when you need them?
  
  * Is the provider taking security measures proportional to the amount of
    funds secured? If they have a million users and don't use cold storage,
    that hot wallet is a million times more valuable for hackers to attack.
    A million times more effort will be taken by hackers to infiltrate their
    security systems. Will they detect when for some software error a hacker
    is spending other people's money before the losses are unrecoverable?
question: Is it self-custodial?
details: >
  A custodial service is a service where the funds are held by a third party
  like the provider. The custodial service can at any point steal all the
  funds of all the users at the custodian's discretion. Our investigations
  stop there.


  Some services might claim their setup is super secure, that they don't
  actually have access to the funds, or that the access is shared between
  multiple parties. For our evaluation of it being a wallet, these details are
  irrelevant. They might be a trustworthy Bitcoin bank and they might be a
  better fit for certain users than being your own bank but our investigation
  still stops there as we are only interested in wallets.


  Apps that claim to be non-custodial but feature custodial accounts without
  very clearly marking those as custodial are also considered "custodial" as a
  whole to avoid trusting users following our assessment to fall for this
  important limitation of said apps.
