title: Reproducible when tested
short: Reproducible
color: '#4da84d'
redflag: false
message: >
  At the time of this analysis, the app as downloaded from the platform was
  reproducible from the code provided by the developers!
explanation : >
  The app can be independently verified. If the provider puts your funds at
  risk on purpose or by accident, security researchers can see this if they
  care to look. It also means that inside the company engineers can verify
  that the release manager is releasing the app based on code known to all
  engineers on the team. A scammer would have to work under the potential eyes
  of security researchers. He would have to take more effort in hiding any
  exploit.
  
  
  "Reproducible" does not mean "verified". There is good reason to believe
  that security researchers as of today would not detect very blatant
  backdoors in the public source code before it gets exploited, much less if
  the attacker takes moderate efforts to hide it.
  
  
  To understand why some lines of difference are ok and others not, one has
  to consider how app signing works. Android supports currently 3 signing
  schemes and in
  [version 1](https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v2#v1-verification)
  the signature is put inside the application file. As the tester must not
  have the release signing key, those files necessarily are missing or differ
  from the version on Google Play. The file `apktool.yml` was never part of
  the app and is generated by the analysis tool
  "[apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)".
question: Does the app we built differ from what we downloaded?
details: >
  If we can reproduce the app we downloaded from the public source code, except
  for the signature, we call the app reproducible. This does not mean we audited
  the code but it's the precondition to make sure the code has relevance for the
  app.
