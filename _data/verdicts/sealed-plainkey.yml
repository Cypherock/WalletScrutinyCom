  These devices keep the user's private key sealed until the seal is broken
  or removed. 
  
  However, in order for a transfer to commence, the private keys
  have to be brought onto a different system that may not necessarily share
  all the desired aspects of a hardware wallet. There are many viruses known
  to look for Bitcoin private keys in memory or hard drives. The keys are not
  outright "leaked" but they are still vulnerable.
