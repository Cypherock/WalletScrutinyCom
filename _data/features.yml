  security:
    title: Security
    description: >
      This aspect encompasses all aspects of keeping one's coins safe. This is
      primarily about keeping the user in control over his coins.
      
      Privacy issues can also affect the security of coins as prospecting
      attackers might find a user due to poor privacy practices but privacy is
      its own aspect.
  onChainPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against on-chain analysis
    description: >
      Blockchain Analysis is a field several companies have specialized in. They
      look at publicly available data - the blockchain - to gain information
      about financial activity. The main interest of on-chain analysis is to
      determine which transactions were done by the same wallet or which wallets
      belong to the same individual. They also track and categorize those
      wallets to provide risk analysis to their clients. In some countries,
      having transactions to or from online casinos might be considered high
      risk, in others transactions to companies that are in the wrong country
      might raise suspicion.
  networkPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against network observers
    description: >
      Analysis companies are known to provide Bitcoin full nodes for the purpose
      of gathering extra information from the wallets that connect to full nodes
      to update their transaction history or to broadcast transactions.
      
      Network observers can also be normal routers on the internet, observing
      unencrypted data.
  providerPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against wallet provider
    description: >
      The wallet provider might know more about the wallet users than is
      knowable from outside. Provider privacy covers features that protect the
      user even against the provider of the wallet.
  savings:
    title: Financial savings

      Some features provide direct financial savings by making transactions
      cheaper.

      This aspect covers all usability features that are not primarily about
      security or privacy.
items:
  fullSegwit:
    short: Full SegWit Support
    description: >
      SegWit which is short for "Segregated Witness" was an upgrade to the Bitcoin
      protocol which came with new address types.
      **Full SegWit Support** means that the wallet can both send to and receive
      to all SegWit address types, including bech32.
    aspects:
      - savings
      - ux
    benefit: >
      * *Receiving to SegWit addresses* provides fee savings, as the sending these
      funds is possible using less base-block space. In Bitcoin, transaction fees
      are proportional to the transaction size in bytes.
      
      * *Receiving to bech32 addresses* provides more fee savings than P2SH
      Segwit addresses.
      
      * *Sending to SegWit addresses* is sometimes required to use more modern
      tools that dropped support for legacy addresses, often because of another
      core property of SegWit transactions: They are not malleable, meaning that
      the transaction ID cannot be changed "in transit" (on unconfirmed
      transactions).
    drawback: null
  payLN:
    short: Send lightning network transactions
    description: >
      The lightning Network (LN) is a layer two protocol that promises instant,
      low fee micro payments. As receiving payments is more complicated than
      sending them, some wallets only implement sending.
    benefit: >
      Transactions on LN are
      
      * *instant*: It usually takes less than five seconds to finish a
      transaction.
      
      * *cheap*: Transactions usually cost a tiny percentage (0.1%) of the
      transferred amount and might also be free.
      
      * *micro payments*: The unit of account on the LN is micro Satoshis (mSat)
      or 0.00000000001 BTC.
    drawback:
      LN is still in early development and several very feasible attacks are known
      that can cost users money or disrupt the network.

  bip37spv:
    short: SPV using bloom filters
    description: >
      Simple Payment Verification (SPV) means the app connects to regular Bitcoin
      full nodes but it does not download the full blockchain. Only the
      transactions relevant to the own wallets.
  bip158spv:
    short: SPV using compact block filters
    description: >
      Compact block filters as in
      [BIP158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)
      are relatively tiny, probabilistic representation of the full
      blockchain which tell the client which block contains transactions
      relevant to specific addresses
    aspects:
      - networkPrivacy
    benefit: >
      Compared to SPV using bloom filters:
      
      * Avoid the leak of the client's addresses to the full nodes it talks to.
      If the blocks are downloaded through TOR with new TOR identities for each
      request from different nodes, the privacy of this mode is almost as good
      as running a full node. An attacker would have to control a big part of
      the TOR network to still learn about which addresses are of interes.
      
      * No re-scan of the full chain needed when importing a wallet.
      
      Compared to using an indexing server of the provider, it leaks no data to
      the provider
    drawback: >
      Compared to using an indexing server it is slower and more bandwidth is
      needed.
  apiServer:
    title: API server provided
    description: >
      The provider runs indexing servers that provide quick access to the state
      of the blockchain.
    aspects:
      - networkPrivacy
      - providerPrivacy
      - ux
    benefit: >
      * Quick access to blockchain data. This wallet probably supports cold
      wallet spending or importing accounts
      
      * Low bandwidth requirements. The servers can deliver data tailored to the
      client's needs without overhead.
      
      * Low CPU and storage requirements. As the server does the heavy-lifting,
      the client doesn't have to.
      
      * Random full nodes cannot spy on the user.
    drawback: >
      The provider can spy on the user.
  TOR:
    title: TOR - The Onion Router
    description: >
      TOR is a tool to shield the IP address of communicating parties. When
      communicating with a node on the TOR network, the communication is also
      necessarily end to end encrypted but not when communicating to a server
      on the internet that does neither use TOR nor ssl (https).
      
      *Modern Androids allow to put apps behind a local TOR node independently of
      the provider offering TOR features. While this can be desirable to shield
      one's IP address, it also might expose unencrypted data to different,
      probably more aware third parties. It also does not replace more advanced
      TOR features in which the wallet creates multiple TOR identities for
      different requests.*
    aspects:
      - networkPrivacy
      - providerPrivacy
    benefit: >
      TOR shields the client's IP address and thus his real world location or
      identity from servers it talks to.
    drawback: >
      TOR means bouncing messages around a bit more with extra encryption.
      That makes it slower.
  lnWatchTowers:

    description: >
      **Non-custodial** Lightning Network wallets that **can receive payments**
      have to be on guard about all transactions happening on the Bitcoin

      [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)
      is a widely used standard for hierarchically deterministic (HD) wallets.
    aspects:

    description: >
      [BIP-49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki)
      accounts are using some of the benefits of SegWit while being compatible
      with old wallets that do not understand bech32 addresses yet.

    benefit: >
      * Accounts can be restored on any BIP-49 compatible wallet, avoiding
      financial loss if the wallet stops working for any reason.
      
      * Funds received to a BIP-49 account can be spent cheaper than funds in
      legacy accounts.

    description: >
      [BIP-84](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki)
      accounts are using some of the benefits of SegWit while being compatible
      with old wallets that do not understand bech32 addresses yet.
    aspects:
      - security
      - ux

    benefit: >
      * Accounts can be restored on any BIP-84 compatible wallet, avoiding
      financial loss if the wallet stops working for any reason.
      
      * Funds received to a BIP-84 account can be spent cheaper than funds in
      BIP-49 or legacy accounts.
    drawback: >
      In some wallets, switching to an account type that is compatible with
      legacy wallets is not trivial. This can result in some friction when
      trying to receive funds from a user of a wallet that does not yet
      understand bech32 addresses.
  RBF:
    title: Replace By Fee (RBF)
    description: >
      This wallet can create transactions that can be replaced until it is
      confirmed by the network.

      Transactions marked as RBF signal the network that they might be replaced
      but with a higher fee per byte.
    aspects:
      - security
      - savings
      - ux
    benefit: >
      * Transactions can be sent with very low fee and if later a soon
      confirmation is desired, the fee can be increased which allows the user to
      use lower fees with more confidence and thus results in fee savings.
      
      * RBF in combination with batching allows the wallet to batch transactions
      [transparent to the
      user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28human%E2%80%93computer_interaction%29),
      making the individual payment cheaper in transaction fees.
    drawback: >
      * Services will normally not accept a payment with RBF until it has a
      confirmation on the blockchain. Wallets that support RBF therefore always
      allow to send transactions without RBF, too but the user might not notice
      this detail while waiting for the recipient to confirm the payment. If
      this happens, a finalizing replacement transaction can be sent.
      
      * RBF sparked some controversy among users portraing RBF transactions as
      double-spend attempts.
      
      * Some wallets that are not aware of the mechanism still might get
      confused and stick to the first transaction seen, ignoring the later
      replacement transaction for longer than necessary.
  batching:
    title: Transaction Batching
    description: >
      Batching allows to aggregate multiple payments into one Bitcoin
      transaction.
    aspects:
      - savings
      - ux
      - onChainPrivacy
    benefit: >
      In Bitcoin, transactions always empty the output of received, prior
      transactions, so called "unspent transaction outputs" or UTXOs. Without
      batching, sending to five recipients requires the creation of five
      transactions with their change outputs - if you don't have the exact
      amount you want to send to the recipient, you send "change" to yourself.
      This change UTXO gets then immediately spent in the next transaction and
      so on, building a chain of transactions.
      
      * Batching avoids creating intermediate outputs, making the transaction
      smaller and thus cheaper in terms of mining fees.
      
      * Batching avoids building chains of transactions. If one were to pay
      more than ten recipients, the network would probably not broadcast the
      later transactions as only short chains of unconfirmed transactions are
      being handled by full nodes. Batching fixes that.
    drawback: >
      Batching makes multiple payments more obvious to originate from the same
      sender, although the chain of transactions confirming in the same block
      also leads to similar conclusions.
  multiSignature:
    title: Multi Signature
    description: >
      Bitcoin allows to define addresses controlled by more than one private
      key. Two-of-three for example would mean that any two of a list of three
      private keys would be required to send coins from this address.
    aspects:
      - ux
      - security
      - onChainPrivacy
      - savings
    benefit: >
      With keys from distinct devices or users, an attacker would have to
      compromise multiple devices or users at once. Multi signature thus allows
      to protect against one device catching a virus, one wallet having a
      backdoor (if the multi signature works across different providers'
      wallets), one hardware wallet not being trusted (if hardware wallets can
      be used for multi signature), etc.
    drawback: >
      * There are no good standards yet for multi signature accounts. This might
      mean that an account that works with one provider's wallet won't load in
      any other wallet which can complicate recovery should that wallet go out
      of business.
      
      * Using Multi Signature results in bigger and thus more expensive
      transactions.
      
      * Using Multi Signature accounts makes it easy for blockchain analysis
      companies to follow the trail of a wallet.
  liquidSidechain:
    title: Liquid Network Accounts
    description: >
      The [Liquid Network](https://www.blockstream.com/liquid/) in the words of
      its developer:
      
      > Liquid is a sidechain-based settlement network for traders and
      exchanges, enabling faster, more confidential Bitcoin transactions and the
      issuance of digital assets.
      
      
      A "federated sidechain" is a blockchain that is not mining with proof of
      work but it has a federation of members that can by majority decide what
      to do with assets under their control. The promise is that sufficient
      competing parties will keep each other honest.
      
      
      A bitcoin sent to the liquid network is sent to a script address of the
      federation with the promise that it can be "sent back to the bitcoin
      network" with an according liquid transaction that will trigger the
      federation to do an according Bitcoin on-chain transaction on behalf of
      the sender of that Liquid transaction.
    aspects:
      - security
      - onChainPrivacy
      - savings
      - ux
    benefit: >
      * Confidential transactions: Liquid transactions by default shield the
      amounts of transactions from the public. Only parties to transactions can
      see amounts relevant to their addresses. This can massively improve the
      on-chain privacy.
      
      * Quicker settlement: Transaction finality is promised after two minutes.
      
      * Many and own custom assets: Liquid allows to issue own assets with the
      same features as for "Liquid Bitcoins".
      
      * Atomic swaps: Tokens on Liquid can be atomically exchanged. If you have
      a "Liquid Bitcoin" and want to exchange it for someone's "Liquid Dogecoin"
      then you can do that in one transaction without the need of a middle man
      or one of the parties going first.
    drawback: >
      * Liquid might not be as trust-less as advertised. It might degrade to a
      quasi custodial wallet [as has happened in the
      past](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1276318599410364416).
      
      * The federation is less decentralized than Bitcoin and can in theory stop
      honoring the users' transactions and spend the Bitcoins that were
      transferred to Liquid otherwise.
  tradeAlts:
    title: Trade from and to other crypto currencies
    description: >
      Many wallets have services integrated that allow you to easily exchange
      one crypto currency for another. You "receive Xcoin to your Ycoin account"
      while in the background the wallet sends your Ycoin address to a service
      provider which gives it an Xcoin address which it then displays. Funds
      sent to that Xcoin address - to that service provider - are then sold for
      Ycoin and the returns are sent to the wallet's Ycoin address.

    benefit: If you want to exchange those coins, it won't get easier.
    drawback: >
      * Sometimes the service is less favorable in its fees when used through a

      app which has internet. That companion app might be on the same phone but
      with internet permission or it might be on a secondary phone such that the
      Air Gapped app can run on a phone that has no mobile or wifi internet
      configured at all.
    aspects:
      - ux
      - security
    benefit: >
      Splitting an app into a part that keeps the keys safe without access to
      leak them online and an app that has internet and all the rest can reduce
      the attack surface for the private keys. In theory this setup can be
      much more secure than the usual app that has both the private keys and
      internet access in one.
    drawback: >
      Having to handle two apps or even two phones is less convenient for
      regular payments.
