fullSegwit:
  short: Full SegWit Support
  description: >
    SegWit which is short for "Segregated Witness" was an upgrade to the Bitcoin
    protocol which came with new address types.
    **Full SegWit Support** means that the wallet can both send to and receive
    to all SegWit address types, including bech32.
  benefit: >
    * *Receiving to SegWit addresses* provides fee savings, as the sending these
    funds is possible using less base-block space. In Bitcoin, transaction fees
    are proportional to the transaction size in bytes.
    
    * *Receiving to bech32 addresses* provides more fee savings than P2SH
    Segwit addresses.
    
    * *Sending to SegWit addresses* is sometimes required to use more modern
    tools that dropped support for legacy addresses, often because of another
    core property of SegWit transactions: They are not malleable, meaning that
    the transaction ID cannot be changed "in transit" (on unconfirmed
    transactions).
  drawback: null
payLN:
  short: Send lightning network transactions
  description: >
    The lightning Network (LN) is a layer two protocol that promises instant,
    low fee micro payments. As receiving payments is more complicated than
    sending them, some wallets only implement sending.
  benefit: >
    Transactions on LN are
    
    * *instant*: It usually takes less than five seconds to finish a
    transaction.
    
    * *cheap*: Transactions usually cost a tiny percentage (0.1%) of the
    transferred amount and might also be free.
    
    * *micro payments*: The unit of account on the LN is micro Satoshis (mSat)
    or 0.00000000001 BTC.
  drawback:
    LN is still in early development and several very feasible attacks are known
    that can cost users money or disrupt the network.

bip37spv:
  short: SPV using bloom filters

    Simple Payment Verification (SPV) means the app connects to regular Bitcoin
    full nodes but it does not download the full blockchain. Only the
    transactions relevant to the own wallets.
