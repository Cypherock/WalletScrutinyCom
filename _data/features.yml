aspects:
  security:
    title: Security
    description: >
      This aspect encompasses all aspects of keeping one's coins safe. This is
      primarily about keeping the user in control over his coins.
      
      Privacy issues can also affect the security of coins as prospecting
      attackers might find a user due to poor privacy practices but privacy is
      its own aspect.
  onChainPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against on-chain analysis
    description: >
      Blockchain Analysis is a field several companies have specialized in. They
      look at publicly available data - the blockchain - to gain information
      about financial activity. The main interest of on-chain analysis is to
      determine which transactions were done by the same wallet or which wallets
      belong to the same individual. They also track and categorize those
      wallets to provide risk analysis to their clients. In some countries,
      having transactions to or from online casinos might be considered high
      risk, in others transactions to companies that are in the wrong country
      might raise suspicion.
  networkPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against network observers
    description: >
      Analysis companies are known to provide Bitcoin full nodes for the purpose
      of gathering extra information from the wallets that connect to full nodes
      to update their transaction history or to broadcast transactions.
      
      Network observers can also be normal routers on the internet, observing
      unencrypted data.
  providerPrivacy:
    title: Privacy against wallet provider
    description: >
      The wallet provider might know more about the wallet users than is
      knowable from outside. Provider privacy covers features that protect the
      user even against the provider of the wallet.
  savings:
    title: Financial savings
    description: >
      Some features provide direct financial savings by making transactions
      cheaper.
  ux:
    title: User experience
    description: >
      This aspect covers all usability features that are not primarily about
      security or privacy.
items:
  fullSegwit:
    short: Full SegWit Support
    description: >
      SegWit which is short for "Segregated Witness" was an upgrade to the Bitcoin
      protocol which came with new address types.
      **Full SegWit Support** means that the wallet can both send to and receive
      to all SegWit address types, including bech32.
    aspects:
      - savings
      - ux
    benefit: >
      * *Receiving to SegWit addresses* provides fee savings, as the sending these
      funds is possible using less base-block space. In Bitcoin, transaction fees
      are proportional to the transaction size in bytes.
      
      * *Receiving to bech32 addresses* provides more fee savings than P2SH
      Segwit addresses.
      
      * *Sending to SegWit addresses* is sometimes required to use more modern
      tools that dropped support for legacy addresses, often because of another
      core property of SegWit transactions: They are not malleable, meaning that
      the transaction ID cannot be changed "in transit" (on unconfirmed
      transactions).
    drawback: null
  payLN:
    short: Send lightning network transactions
    description: >
      The lightning Network (LN) is a layer two protocol that promises instant,
      low fee micro payments. As receiving payments is more complicated than
      sending them, some wallets only implement sending.
    benefit: >
      Transactions on LN are
      
      * *instant*: It usually takes less than five seconds to finish a
      transaction.
      
      * *cheap*: Transactions usually cost a tiny percentage (0.1%) of the
      transferred amount and might also be free.
      
      * *micro payments*: The unit of account on the LN is micro Satoshis (mSat)
      or 0.00000000001 BTC.
    drawback:
      LN is still in early development and several very feasible attacks are known
      that can cost users money or disrupt the network.

  bip37spv:
    short: SPV using bloom filters
    description: >
      Simple Payment Verification (SPV) means the app connects to regular Bitcoin
      full nodes but it does not download the full blockchain. Only the
      transactions relevant to the own wallets.
