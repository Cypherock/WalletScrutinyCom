**build**
: A program that you can run is generated based on some source code. The process of generating the program from the code is called building.

**verifiable build**
: A build where a third party can verify the binary to match the source code is called verifiable.

**deterministic build**
: If the build process does not depend on external factors such as time or machine it is run on, it deterministically results in the same output for the same input.

**reproducible build**
: see deterministic build

**APK**
: Android apps are distributed as files with the `.apk` extension. It's an install package that contains all the properties of the executable app.
