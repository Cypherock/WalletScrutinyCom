**Wallet Scrutiny** is a project aimed at improving the security of
Android Bitcoin Wallets.


What protects your Bitcoins?

Do you own your Bitcoins or do you trust that your app allows you to use "your"
coins while they are actually controlled by "them"? Do you have a backup? Do

or vulnerabilities? Could anybody check the wallet for those?

We try to answer these questions for the main Bitcoin wallets on Android.

Read about [our methodology](/methodology/) to understand in more detail or just
