**Wallet Security Guard** is a project aimed at improving the security of the
major Bitcoin wallets.

What made us start this page?
========

Not only in our job at Mycelium, we cared about wallet security. How should we
trust any of them without compiling them ourselves?

Reviewing the changes that go into a wallet is a full time job and
security considerations are a common reason to reject changes at Mycelium.

Many wallets boast to be open source but do not provide even the claim of being
verifiable, with some even hiding the team in secrecy, making them the perfect
candidates for exit scams.

How can we raise awareness to the issue of released binaries not being what the
authors claim they are? Do we need a few wallets exit-scamming or can we
protect at least the cautious users? And lastly, are the cautious users willing
to chip in to improve the situation in one form or another?
