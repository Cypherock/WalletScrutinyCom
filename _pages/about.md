**Wallet Scrutiny** is a project aimed at improving the security of
Android Bitcoin Wallets.


What protects your Bitcoins from Hackers?
============================

Do you own your Bitcoins or do you trust that your app allows you to use "your"
coins while they are actually controlled by "them"? Do you have a backup? Do
"they" have a copy they didn't tell you about? Did anybody check the wallet for deliberate backdoors
or vulnerabilities? Could anybody check the wallet for those?

We try to answer these questions for Bitcoin wallets on Android.
