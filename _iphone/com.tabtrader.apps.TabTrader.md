This app appears to not function as a wallet. At least we could not see any
documentation about depositing or withdrawing through the app, which makes the
verdict **not a wallet** but the app still has still massive potential for abuse
if the provider front-runs the trades of the users from the insight they gain or
even worse, they could trigger lucrative-to-front-run trades the user never
intended to make.
