This app appears to be an interface to a custodial trading platform. In the
App Store description we read:

> - Uphold is fully reserved. Unlike banks, we donâ€™t loan out your money. To
    prove it, we publish our holdings in real-time.

If they hold your money, you don't. As a custodial service this app is **not
verifiable**.
