**Note:** It's a Korean app and may not have an English translation. To add to that, there seems to be two official websites: [huobiwallet.com](https://www.huobiwallet.com/) and [hb.co.kr](https://www.hb.co.kr/)

Neither on Google Play nor on their website can we find a claim of a
non-custodial part to this app. We assume it is a purely custodial interface to
the exchange of same name and therefore **not verifiable**
