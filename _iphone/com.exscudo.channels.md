The App Store description states...

> All funds are fully protected and no one except the owner can access them.

so the provider is sort of claiming the wallet is non-custodial.
However no source code can be found in a public repository for validation.

Our verdict: This ‘wallet’ claims to be non-custodial, however with no source
code this is **not verifiable**.
