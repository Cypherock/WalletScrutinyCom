**Update 2021-03-22:** Already in January the provider added *"- This wallet is
hosted by BlueWallet."* without any further explanation that this means that
BlueWallet which appears to not be a legal entity is in control of the Bitcoins
on those LN accounts. They also closed
[the issue about the disclaimer](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/2364).

**Update 2020-07-14**: This app was earlier classified as non-custodial but as their main
selling point is their *"Unfairly cheap and blazing fast transactions on
Bitcoin"* Lighning Wallet and that wallet is custodial without warning the user
about this fact, we have to change our verdict although in summary the verdict
remains **not verifiable**.
