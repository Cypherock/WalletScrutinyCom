This app's description loses no word on who holds the keys to your coins. Their
website is mainly about the exchange and not about the mobile appp but there is
[a site about that](https://bitbay.net/en/mobile), too. There they only talk
about exchange features, too and lose no word about who holds the keys which
probably means this app is a custodial offering and therefore **not verifiable**.
