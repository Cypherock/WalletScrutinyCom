In the description on the App Store we read:

> â€¢ Your Nexo account is secured through BitGo, the leader in crypto
  custodianship, and benefits from top-tier insurance.

which makes it a custodial app. The custodian is claimed to be "BitGo" so as a
user you have to trust BitGo to not lose the coins and Nexo to actually not hold
all or part of the coins. In any case this app is **not verifiable**.
