This app is not well advertised on how the users private keys are managed.
At best this is a custodial wallet, we also note there is only One 1 star review on the [iphone app store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/b4u-wallet/id1491304459?ls=1).

Our verdict: This "wallet" is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
