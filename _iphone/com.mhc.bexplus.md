The Bexplus website states under the mobile wallet section "Assets Security"

> Assets are stored in cold storage against stealing and loss

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and
hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
