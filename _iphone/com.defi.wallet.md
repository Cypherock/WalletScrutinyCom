This app's description is promising:

> Decentralized:
> - Gain full control of your crypto and private keys [...]

On their website though we cannot find any links to source code.

Searching their `appId` on GitHub,
[yields nothing](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.defi.wallet%22) neither.

This brings us to the verdict: **not verifiable**.
