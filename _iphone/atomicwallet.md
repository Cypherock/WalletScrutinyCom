**Update 2022-01-02**: This app is no more available.

> Atomic Wallet is a universal, fully decentralized, multi-currency, and
  convenient app with a simple interface that supports over 300
  cryptocurrencies.

so they claim to be non-custodial but although they feature a link to
[their GitHub account](https://github.com/Atomicwallet), none of the
repositories there looks like an iPhone wallet so the app is **not verifiable**.
