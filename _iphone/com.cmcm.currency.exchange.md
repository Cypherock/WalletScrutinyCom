This app is heavily focused on the "exchange" part which is also in its name.
Nowhere on the App Store can we find claims about self-custody but things like

> - Applies the advanced multi-layer clustered system and the hot/cold wallet

only make sense for custodial apps. As a custodial app it is **not verifiable**.
