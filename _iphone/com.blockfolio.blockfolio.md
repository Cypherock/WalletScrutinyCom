**Update 2021-08-09**: There are a total of 6 related apps that all appear to belong to the same "FTX":

* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.blockfolio.blockfolio' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.blockfolio.blockfolio' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.ftxmobile.ftx' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/org.reactjs.native.example.FTXMobile.FTX' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.ftxmobile.ftxus' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.ftx.FTXMobile.FTXUS' %}

This app clearly sounds like an exchange that lets
you buy, hold, send and receive BTC but as an exchange it's certainly custodial
and thus **not verifiable**.
