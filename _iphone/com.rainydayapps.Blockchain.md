On the App Store we read:

> Only you have access to your private keys and your crypto.

and on the website there is a link to
[this GitHub account](https://github.com/blockchain/) but no claim about which
repository is supposed to be behind this wallet but we assume it's
[this](https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-V3-iOS).

As with all iPhone app, reproducible builds do not exist so far, so the app
is **not verifiable**.
