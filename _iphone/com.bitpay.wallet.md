BitPay – Secure Bitcoin Wallet links to its source code on their App Store
description.

As reproducible builds are a general problem with how the App Store works,
this app just like its Android version is **not verifiable**.

See the Android version to get an idea of how (not so) easy it is to build the
app from the source code.
