With this statement below from the providers [App store description](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1459475831), it is clear that the user is not in control of the wallets private keys.

> Easy and secure wallet
> Easy wallet service without managing private keys and mnemonics.

Our Verdict: This "wallet" is custodial and therefor **not verifiable**
