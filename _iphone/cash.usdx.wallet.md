This statement in the description from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/app/usdx-wallet-with-a-stablecoin/id1367451869) below is a claim the user only has access to the private keys.

> Your private key is encrypted and stored safely; only you can decrypt it and perform transactions. 

With keys in control of the user, we need to find the source code in order to check reproducibility.
However we are unable to locate a public source repository.

Our verdict: As there is no source code to be found anywhere, this wallet is at best a non-custodial closed source wallet and as such **not verifiable**.
