The app appears to have tons of features but nowhere can we find a word about
where the bitcoins are stored.
[Their FAQ](https://support.coins.ph/hc/en-us/categories/202504637-Safety-Security)
is talking a lot about "account is deactivated" or "temporarily disabled" which
are concepts not known in self-custodial wallets.

We assume this app is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
