This is the iPhone version of [this Android wallet](/android/com.incognito.wallet).

Here we read the same claim as for Android:

> Don’t leave yourself exposed. Go Incognito. It’s non-custodial, decentralized,
  and completely open-source.

and get to the same conclusion about the state of their source code: Without
build instructions and all the files, this app cannot be reproduced and remains
**not verifiable**.
