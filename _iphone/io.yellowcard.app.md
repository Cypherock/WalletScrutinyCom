The Yellow Card wallet has no statements on
[their website](https://yellowcard.io/) or in their FAQ regarding the management
of private keys.
This leads us to conclude the wallet funds are likely under the control of the
provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is **not verifiable**.
