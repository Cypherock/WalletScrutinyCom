Enjin: Blockchain & Crypto Wallet
description starts promising:

> "Your private keys are your own"

They advertise advanced securing techniques among which are:

> An extensive independent security audit and penetration test found no security
  issues.

(You can read the report
[here](https://cdn.enjin.io/files/pdfs/enjin-wallet-security-audit.pdf))

But source code isn't available on [their website](https://github.com/enjin).
So the user is left with only one choice: trust.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
