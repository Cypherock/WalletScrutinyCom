In the description we can read:

> Secure<br>
  Wallet Passphrase & private keys never leave device

and

> FreeWallet is an open source mobile wallet which supports Bitcoin.

so it's a non-custodial, open source Bitcoin wallet but can we verify the
claims?

On their website we find a link to their GitHub and from their to the mobile
wallet's repository. There we find no claims of reproducibility and not even
build isntructions, so this app is **not verifiable**.
