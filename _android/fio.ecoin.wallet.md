**Update 2021-09-15**: This app is not on the Play Store anymore.

At the interim, ecoin seems to have functionality allowing the user to buy bitcoin. We downloaded the app, and it doesn't. 

Once you sign in on the main page, you will be given the option to go to another website called [TheCoin.exchange](http://thecoin.exchange). Here you can buy Ecoin, USDT, TRX and PBTC - Tethered Bitcoin which is an ERC-20 token.

Hence the verdict of **nowallet**
