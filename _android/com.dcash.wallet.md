This app looks like a custodial offering:

> RenrenBit is a digital asset management platform offering 100% Reserve.

As it only has 100 downloads its category is "few users" though.

Suspiciously Google Play features no website, the contact is
`muhuai@renrenbit.com` but renrenbit.com featuring both Android and iPhone logos
for app downloads that only appear to link to an
[app on iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/renrenbit/id1443447248).
