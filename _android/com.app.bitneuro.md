## App Description

The app has a graphical "Buy" or "Sell" meter which gives signals to traders. Other features include:

> - Real-time quotes
> - Signals and alerts
> - Coin exchange selection advice
> - Social Community Forum

## Verdict

This app only provides trade signals and a trading bot that can link to Binance via an API. It **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
