The description of this app talks about how many coins it supports and mentions
of KYC and give the impression it is a custodial service. Their website is
currently down:

Cloudflare says:
> Error 521 Ray ID: 54c2d0873f95d64d â€¢ 2019-12-28 10:22:41 UTC
  Web server is down

Absent further information we have to assume this is a custodial service.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
