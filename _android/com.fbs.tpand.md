From the app description:
>All-in-one multi-asset trading platform for facile online trading anywhere. Seize market opportunities in a few taps and trade smart.

>Crypto trading is available 24/7 – enter trades at any time you want.

It calls itself a trading platform not a wallet. There was no mention of sending or receiving BTC or any other crypto either.

>5.3.2. Transfer between third parties is not possible except internal transfers between a partner and his clients that are processed manually as well;
