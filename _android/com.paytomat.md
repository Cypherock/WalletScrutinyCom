This app gets straight to the point:

> The wallet is non-custodial, meaning the private keys never leave the secure
storage of your phone.

but can we verify this?

On their website we find a [link to their GitHub](https://github.com/Paytomat)
but none of

* **wallet-connect-android** Binance implementation of Wallet Connect protocol as kotlin library
* **ScatterKit** ScatterKit allows communication between Swift applications and web pages that use Scatter plugin
* **Paytomat-iOS-SDK** Send transactions and get account information via Paytomat Wallet
* **Paytomat-Android-SDK** Send transactions and get account information via Paytomat Wallet
* **paytomat-api** Docs for various Paytomat APIs

sounds like an actual Wallet.

Searching GitHub for
[their app id](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.paytomat%22&type=Code) yields
401 results which we should not be tasked to look through one by one.

So for now we assume it is closed source and come to the verdict: **not verifiable**.
