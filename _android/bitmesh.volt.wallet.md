## App Description

It advertises itself as:

> Volt is a wallet that grandma can use **by removing key management responsibility away from end users.** It is as easy to set up and use as any other apps we use daily.

Volt claims to be able to store funds securely and transfer funds easily.

It also does not provide mnemonics to users as seen in this quote below:

> Easy setup: Set up the wallet by verifying email and connect your faceid without having to write down mnemonic words and worry about losing it. There is no private key upon wallet creation and nor is a full private key is formed or used during the transaction signing process. This removes single point failure problem which happens with all mnemonic words based wallets.

## The Site



> There are no private keys generated upon account creation and during all signing process.
>
> This solution provides better security and privacy compared with private key based accounts and p2sh based multisig solutions.
