**Update 2021-08-21**: This app is no more.

This app pretends to be the hugely anticipated
[app by the government of El Salvador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xEF-E2hs)
but with no government website linking there and the app not claiming to have a
website and the developer email being "just" some gmail address, we can assume
this is a fake wallet.

We first heard about this app from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ClaudyCordova).
