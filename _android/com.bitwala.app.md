From the site description:

> Nuri is the app to manage, save and grow your money. Invest in cryptocurrencies, create savings plans & earn up to 5% interest per year on bitcoin directly from a German bank account.

The app is complicated as it offers both custodial and non-custodial wallets. But then again, if a user has to pass ID verification and KYC, then even the non-custodial offering is in fact, **custodial**.

It identifies its non-custodial wallets as ["Vaults"](https://nuri.com/how-to/wallet/)

> The Bitcoin (BTC) VAult is available on both web and mobile devices and is a multi-signature non-custodial wallet. A multi-signature protocol, available for Bitcoin acts as a built-in additional security factor. The wallet is backed up with two seed phrases, which let you recover and access your bitcoin in case you lose access to your Nuri account. Under no circumstances, Nuri or anyone else can access or control your funds or transactions.
