The CoinZoom [support FAQ](https://www.coinzoom.com/support/) states the wallet is custodial... 
Found under "Where can I find the private keys for my wallet?"

> As CoinZoom is a hosted wallet, it's not feasible to provide the private keys to individual wallet addresses; doing so would prevent us from taking advantage of our secure cold-storage technology to protect your funds.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
