## App Description

> Spatium is a unique keyless crypto wallet that allows you to easily and safely buy, store, and send crypto.
> 
> Spatium wallet, based on SMPC technology and anonymous biometrics, allows you to manage digital assets **without a Private Key**. It’s replaced with an encrypted set of secrets distributed between your device and professional security provider.
>
> This makes Spatium the safest and easiest crypto wallet. We eliminate the weakness and enhance functionality by replacing the Private Key with the set of secrets that are generated, stored, and processed independently and never occur in one place. No one can steal your Private Key if it does not exist.

It further claims to use biometrics to allow users to recover their data. It details more information on its [Medium blog](https://medium.com/spatium-blog).


## The App

There is a Bitcoin wallet with a send and receive function. Backup is possible through the use of biometric data.

## [Termination Clause in User Agreement](https://spatium.net/user-agreement.html)

> Upon termination of the Agreement, your account will cease to exist (be deleted). Upon termination of this Agreement, we will cease to provide services and you will cease to have access to the Application.
>
> If you terminate the Agreement for any reason, you will not be entitled to any refund of fees for use of features of the Application (if any) or any other fees. No data from your prior Reports will ever be available to you.

## Closed Source

> reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software, except as expressly permitted by law in the jurisdiction in which you are located;

> rent, lease, sell, assign or otherwise transfer the rights to the Application;

## Verdict

Without the private keys, we do not consider hashed biometric data as a suitable replacement. Add to that the ability to terminate access to the application plus their unwillingness to share their source code. We believe at this point that this is a **custodial** service. Especially because of the phrase: "It’s replaced with an encrypted set of secrets distributed between your device and professional security provider."

Precisely [who this security provider is, we're not so sure](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1458713393607577600). It could be a third party, thus our verdict of **custodial**. The app **cannot be verified**.
