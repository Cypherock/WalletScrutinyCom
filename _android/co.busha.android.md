The description

> Wonâ€™t you rather trade and store your crypto assets on a platform you can
  trust? Busha is a Nigerian based crypto exchange that offers you all these and
  more.

sounds like it's an app to access an account on a custodial platform.

On their website they are more explicit:

> **Safe & Secure**<br>
  Our 24/7 monitoring systems, cold storage and industry-standard multi-sig
  wallets ensure that your assets are the safest they can be.

which is a list of features only relevant in a custodial context.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
