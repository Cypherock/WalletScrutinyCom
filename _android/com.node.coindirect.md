It is concerning to see a wallet with a rating of less than 2 in the Google Play
Store with close to 500 total ratings.
The website really states nothing about private key management. Just some reference to cold storage of bitcoins.

> The majority of our usersâ€™ Bitcoins are kept securely in cold storage. This is equivalent to a digital bank vault.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
