Binarium is a

> simple and user-friendly trading platform

and mostly offers for trading popular assets on the market.

[The FAQ on withdrawing funds](https://binarium.global/main/faq) :

> verification is mandatory for submitting a withdrawal request. It is a guarantee that your funds won't become fraud or money laundering target.

Usually in a non-custodial BTC wallet, the user would be provided with the private keys. There's no mention of that here however, so presumably the private keys are on the side of the provider?

Verdict: We're assuming this app is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable.**
