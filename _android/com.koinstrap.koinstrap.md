## App Description

This app is only available in Nigeria. It claims to allow the buying and selling of cryptocurrency as well as the sending and receiving of it. 

## Termination Clause in [Terms](https://koinstrap.com/terms)

> You shall not unlawfully access or attempt to gain access, reverse engineer or otherwise circumvent any security measures that we have applied to our Platform and/or computer system(s). If, at our sole discretion, we were to determine that you are in breach of this clause, we reserve the right to take all action as we see fit, including, without limitation, completely blocking your access to our Platform, blocking and/or revoking your Access Codes and/or terminating your Koinstrap Account.

## The App

We were not able to register with the app due to a strange error that limits the characters of the email address to 30 [(we posted the screenshot on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1459072934471888897). Our email address is only 29-characters. 

We tried on multiple platforms both on an Android emulator and a phone. We received the same error. 

Koinstrap has a [status page](https://status.koinstrap.com/) that does not seem to be operable.

We contacted Koinstrap via [their twitter account](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1459069782393643012) to ask about the error. 

## Verdict

In the [FAQ section](https://koinstrap.com/faqs) of their website, they noted that they secure the funds of their users via offline storage:

> **Is Koinstrap very secured?**<br>
We may wish to inform you that all the digital currencies on our website are fully secured and are being stored in an offline vault.

This, along with a termination clause that gives Koinstrap the power to completely block or revoke access to their platform, makes their service **custodial**. This makes the app **non-verifiable**.
