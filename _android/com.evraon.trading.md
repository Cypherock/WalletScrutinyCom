## Verdict

The app is primarily an interface for using a cryptocurrency trading bot that can interface with Binance and Bitmex. You can configure the bot through the ["strategy editor"](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1460163152050491398). It also has an internal "wallet" but is denominated in EUSD. It also has [charts for cryptocurrency trading pairs](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1460163775319793672/photo/1) which can be helpful for traders. It **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
