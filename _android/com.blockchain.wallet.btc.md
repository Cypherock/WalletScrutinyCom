There is no clear statement from this provider as to how private keys are managed.
However there is an open source repository for the source code under GPLv3 licence.

Our Verdict: WIP, to be verified.

A couple of observations to note. 
1) The providers website is defunct and does not load (https://adslab-2b1c2.web.app/)
2) The github repository of the claimed open source software only has one contributor !
