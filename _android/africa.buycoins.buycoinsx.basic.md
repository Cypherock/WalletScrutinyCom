## The Site

### Terms of Service

The [Terms](https://buycoins.africa/terms) specify the site's power to freeze the assets of the user in section 5.4, 

> We reserve the right to **cancel and/or suspend your Buycoins Account and/or block transactions or freeze funds immediately and without notice if we determine, in our sole discretion**, that your Account is associated with a Prohibited Use and/or a Prohibited Business.

## The App

We downloaded the app and tried to register. We were unable to register because the OTP (One-Time Password) did not arrive.

## Verdict

Despite our inability to register both on the app and on the web platform, we have sufficient reason to believe that this app is custodial due to their ability to cancel the accounts and freeze the funds of users. Any app that that has the ability to do this **in their own sole discretion** makes it **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable**.
