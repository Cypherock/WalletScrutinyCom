Stated in their sites [support article](https://support.chippercash.com/en/articles/4750740-how-to-buy-sell-cryptocurrency-on-chipper-cash) 
"Currently it's not possible to send to or receive Bitcoin or Ethereum from external wallets"

Conclusion is that Chipper is a custodial wallet as funds are held by Chipper on behalf of the user.
