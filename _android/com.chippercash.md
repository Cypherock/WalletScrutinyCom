Stated in their sites [support article](https://support.chippercash.com/en/articles/4750740-how-to-buy-sell-cryptocurrency-on-chipper-cash) 
"Currently it's not possible to send to or receive Bitcoin or Ethereum from external wallets"

Conclusion is that Chipper is a custodial wallet as funds are held by Chipper on behalf of the user.

**Edit:** 

> We're excited to introduce the Crypto RECEIVE feature. This will enable you receive Bitcoin/Ethereum/USDC from another Crypto(ETH/BTC/USDC) address.

As of this date it seems that it's now possible to send and receive from external addresses.
