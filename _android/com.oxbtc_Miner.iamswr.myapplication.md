⚠️ **Caution:** TrendMicro has an [article](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/fake-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-trick-victims-into-watching-ads-.html) about fake cloud mining apps on Google Play. Proceed with caution.

## App Description

This app claims to be a cloud mining app.

### Google Play Critical reviews

## The Site

> - Instead of buying any mining rigs, you can just start your mining journey online from the purchase of cloud mining smart contracts.
> - Free from additional risks such as mining machine failure or poor performance, you can mine with lower maintenance costs yet enjoy stable investment yields.
> - You are saved from the trouble of dealing with waste machines upon contract termination.

Users are encouraged to invest in mining contracts that cost $43.80 per Terahash. They have a calculator that claims to provide x number of bitcoins daily profit based on several factors.

The site has been in existence since [2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20161024161526/https://oxbtc.com/).

## The App

We downloaded and registered with the oxbtc service. Google Auth 2FA, phone number and passwords were required. There was a Bitcoin wallet with the ability to **send and receive.** ETH, USDT, LTC and other coins.

There was no ios app, only testflight.

## Verdict

The account that we created was the same on the mobile phone and the web app. The account had deposit and withdrawal features. However, we were not able to find the private key, seed or mnemonics. This is a cloud mining app with a Bitcoin wallet included. The service is **custodial** which makes the app **not-verifiable.**
