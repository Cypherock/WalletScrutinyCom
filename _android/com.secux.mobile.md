       Terrible App. I have emailed customer service twice..no reply. I installed new firmware and then lost 1000 xrp. I just transfered bitcoi 30min before this review. Lost that too. The device and app are Not worth your time or money. Its not secure as advertised

       The app nor the bluetooth device works. It requires you to sign in via bluetooth or usb. However if you plug the usb it says no compatible devices found and if you attempt to use the bluetooth the website will not react. It says you have to turn on bluetooth from the hardware wallet and the device (phone or laptop) but the wallet does not have an option for bluetooth in its settings. If I could give zero stars I would. Avoid at all cost.

## Verdict

Since this is related to a hardware wallet, we will mark it for reclassification and a work in progress.
