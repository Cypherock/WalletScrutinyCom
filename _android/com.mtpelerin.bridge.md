On Google Play they claim

> **YOU ARE IN CONTROL**<br>
  Bridge Wallet is a decentralized, non-custodial wallet. It means that you are
  in full control of your wallet, its content and seed phrase.

But while the provider [has a GitHub presence](https://github.com/MtPelerin),
there is no claim about public source and neither do we find any wallet
repository on their GitHub.

As a closed source wallet, this is **not verifiable**.
