It has a Crypto Exchange interface and refers to itself as such. One of its general features advertise wallet service. This sounds custodial.

>  [To make the deposit find the required currency,](https://help.stex.com/en/articles/1657710-how-do-i-deposit-crypto-currencies) click on "deposit" , and generate address of your wallet by clicking on 'show me the deposit address'.

It's possible to send/[receive](https://help.stex.com/en/articles/1657719-how-do-i-withdraw-crypto-currencies) in this product.

This app being **custodial,** it's also **not verifiable.**
