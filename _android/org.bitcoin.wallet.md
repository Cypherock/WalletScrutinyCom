[Emanuel](/authors/emanuel) looked into this wallet a bit as it claims
association with a pretty prominent website - bitcoin.org and indeed it is
[endorsed](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/BitcoinWalletMobile/issues/4) by
[Cobra-Bitcoin](https://github.com/Cobra-Bitcoin), the owner of bitcoin.org.
