It's not really clear what the difference is between [CoinDCX **Pro**](https://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.coindcx) and CoinDCX **Go** but they're from the same providers. We can assume that they have the same verdict.

> Our cryptocurrency wallets are extremely secure and the funds are ensured with BitGo. 98% of CoinDCX's funds are held in geographically distributed multi-signature cold wallets.

This product is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable**.
