> [At this time, Wealthsimple Crypto](https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/360056581494-Will-I-be-able-to-bring-over-my-existing-cryptocurrencies-) only supports the ability to deposits and withdrawal Canadian dollars to and from the platform. Weâ€™re unable to accept any transfers of existing cryptocurrency held at other institutions or in a private wallet!

Users can't send or receive their BTC and it appears they have to convert to fiat to withdraw.
