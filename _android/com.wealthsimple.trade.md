> Buy and sell 16+ cryptocurrencies in just a few taps with Wealthsimple Crypto. There’s no long list of fees or account minimums. Just simple and secure crypto trading of Bitcoin (BTC)[...]

Sounds like a trading platform. The Privacy Policy had some information:

> The personal information we collect when you open an account is used for the following purposes: 

> * understanding your financial needs and delivering financial products and services that meet them;
> * verifying your identity and other information you have provided to us;
> * opening and servicing your account;

> [At this time, Wealthsimple Crypto](https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/360056581494-Will-I-be-able-to-bring-over-my-existing-cryptocurrencies-) only supports the ability to deposits and withdrawal Canadian dollars to and from the platform. We’re unable to accept any transfers of existing cryptocurrency held at other institutions or in a private wallet!

Users **can't send or receive their BTC** and it appears they have to convert to fiat to withdraw.
