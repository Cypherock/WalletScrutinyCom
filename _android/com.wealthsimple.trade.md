> Buy and sell 16+ cryptocurrencies in just a few taps with Wealthsimple Crypto. Thereâ€™s no long list of fees or account minimums. Just simple and secure crypto trading of Bitcoin (BTC)[...]

Sounds like a trading platform. The Privacy Policy had some information:

> The personal information we collect when you open an account is used for the following purposes: 
> * understanding your financial needs and delivering financial products and services that meet them;
> * verifying your identity and other information you have provided to us;
> * opening and servicing your account;
> * sending and receiving bill payments through your chequing account
> * detecting and preventing fraud and other unauthorized or illegal activities;
> * meeting legal and regulatory requirements;
> * transferring your account to or from another institution; and
>   as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

We conclude that this is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**
