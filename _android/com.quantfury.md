Description from the site: 

> Сommission-free trading and investing at real-time spot prices of global and crypto exchanges.

Initially, it may appear like Quantfury is an exchange. But upon closer inspection of its Terms and Conditions, we discovered that it utilizes a third party provider: Coinpayments. Cognizance should also be given to the fact that it is described as a "brokerage" service, albeit with features that make it appear like it were an online exchange.

Here are more details:

The platform provides services for: Crypto, Stocks, Futures, ETFs.

QuantFury [Terms and Conditions Page](https://quantfury.com/quantfury-terms-and-conditions.pdf)

> Quantfury (!Quantfury”), provides a mobile application-based platform (the !Quantfury App”) that allows users of the Quantfury App (!Traders”) to obtain economic exposure to the price movementof  an  underlying financial  instrument  (including,  stocks,  ETFs,  commodity  futures,  index  futures, cryptocurrency pairs, and fiat currency pairs) without the need for ownership and physical settle-ment of the underlying financial instrument (the !Service”).

Of particular note here is the section pertaining to wallet custody:
