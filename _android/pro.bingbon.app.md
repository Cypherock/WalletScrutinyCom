We cannot find any claims as to the custody of private keys found from Bingbon.
We must assume the wallet app is custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.

Note: Althrough there is an iPhone AppStore link on the [Bingbon site](https://bingbon.com), there is no page (404 Page Not Found) or evidence that an iphone wallet exists.
