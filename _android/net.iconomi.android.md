#### Terms and Conditions

Custodial cryptocurrency services are mostly compliant given the increasing regulatory approach by most countries towards cryptocurrencies.

Iconomi's [Terms and Conditions](https://www.iconomi.com/legal/terms-and-conditions) show that they are compliant:

> ICONOMI LTD has been temporarily registered under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 as a crypto asset business until 31 March 2022, pending the determination of our application by the Financial Conduct Authority. Our cryptoasset activity is not within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service nor subject to protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

### The App

We downloaded the app to our test Samsung phone. 

### Verdict
