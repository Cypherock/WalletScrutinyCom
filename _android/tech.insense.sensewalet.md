In their description we read:

> *You, as owner of wallet, fully control the private key:*
  * "iWallet"does not store info about users, data about private keys, or funds
    on servers.
  * Private keys are stored on your device.

so they are non-custodial.

The following is their website in its entirety:

So, trusting their claim from the Play Store, not finding any further data to
verify it, we remain with the verdict: **not verifiable**.
