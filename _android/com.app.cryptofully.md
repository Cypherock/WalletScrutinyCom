This mobile app is a exchange solution aimed at transferring money into Nigerian bank accounts, on their site https://www.cryptofully.com/ there is no mention of any source repository for it.
This mobile solution looks to work via an Api and does not hold crypto currencies, hence it is not a wallet.

There is also an iphone version.
