### App Description
From the app description: 

> PayBito helps you manage your portfolio, buy & sell cryptocurrencies and send & receive crypto straight from your phone.

PayBito primarily advertises itself as a trading platform. It offers support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, or even altcoins.

We can assume it at least functions as a "wallet" although we have no word on privacy other than:

> Secure your funds with heavy data encryption 

### The Site
Interestingly, the linked website in the store page leads to the company's website while the [privacy policy](https://www.paybito.com/privacy-policy/) leads to what appears to be the app's website.


From the [Terms of Use](https://www.paybito.com/terms-of-use/) we find that Paybito keeps your assets in custody (4.1):

> We strive to protect your crypto assets from unauthorized access, use, or spending. We use a variety of physical and technical measures designed to protect our systems and your crypto assets. By remitting your crypto assets to PayBito Account you entrust and entitle Us to ultimately take decisions on the safety and security of your crypto assets.

### Verdict
This app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
