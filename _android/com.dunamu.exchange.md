There are two versions of this app: one for Korea and one that's global. 

Upbit uses ID verification and KYC therefore we can assume that it is **custodial** and **not verifiable**. You cannot deposit or withdraw BTC as well as other altcoins without finishing their level 2 KYC. They also claim to have multi-sig and cold wallets.
