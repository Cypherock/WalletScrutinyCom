On Google Play we read

> As a multi-asset web wallet, users are in full control of their private keys

so we assume this app is non-custodial.

On their Website we read again

> **Own Your Private Keys**
>
> Private keys for cryptocurrency addresses are created client side through a
  proprietary method and are never stored or sent back to our servers

which is actually very scary. "Proprietary method" means non-standard method, so
if this wallet stops working, there is no way to get your funds recovered on a
different wallet.

On their website there is a link to a [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/vidulum/vidulum.app) but that  only contains one
text file and no code.

The app is closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
