## App Description

> - Execute trades in several pairs
> - Deposit and withdraw crypto assets

This is a cryptocurrency exchange.

## Verdict

Although the service doesn't seem to have a Terms and Conditions page, AML/KYC and other regulatory documentation, cryptocurrency exchanges that don't claim otherwise, usually are **custodial** and their apps **cannot be verified**.
