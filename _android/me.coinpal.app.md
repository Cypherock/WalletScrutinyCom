The providers [Play store description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.coinpal.app) states the customer is in control of the private keys.

> Device-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud

This is a non-cusdodial wallet however

Our verdict: As there is no source code to be found anywhere, this wallet is at best a non-custodial closed source wallet and as such **not verifiable**.
