> Make any available computers (Windows or macOS) work for you – instead of worthless dust collecting, they will bring you passive income in BTC.

According to the description, you can use this app to install "a high-performance miner"

Doesn't exactly sound like a BTC wallet.  

> With us, your income is under reliable protection. Withdraw your funds with no limitations anytime, even on the first day of mining.

So a third-party is in control of your funds. 

> You can withdraw funds from CryptoTab Farm to your CryptoTab account.<br>
  From the CryptoTab balance, you can withdraw them to any Bitcoin wallet.

You can store BTC earned from mining, but you can't deposit funds. You can still withdraw it into a separate Bitcoin wallet.

Verdict: This is **not a wallet.**
