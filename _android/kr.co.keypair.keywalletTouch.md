The description makes rather vague claims:

> - Fully complied with HD(Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet

which is a standard that makes most sense for self-custodial wallets.

> This application manages crypto wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, ERC20
  tokens and etc.

Now this might be a language barrier issue but we would hope it is a wallet and
not an application to manage wallets aka "not a wallet"?

Their website appears to be no more and we get forwarded to
[some Korean site](http://html.ugo.kr/servicestop.html) that according to Google
translate reads:

> This is to inform you that the "service period has expired" for this site .

There is another website though: [afinkeywallet.io](https://afinkeywallet.io)

So in the best of cases this is a functioning closed source self-custodial
Bitcoin wallet and thus **not verifiable**.
