In the description on Google Play we read:

> â€¢ 100% Secured by Leading Audited Custodian BitGo

which makes it a custodial app. The custodian is claimed to be "BitGo" so as a
user you have to trust BitGo to not lose the coins and Nexo to actually not hold
all or part of the coins. In any case this app is **not verifiable**.
