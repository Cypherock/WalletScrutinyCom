**Update 2021-07-18**: Currently the app is not on the App Store.

The Yellow Card wallet has no statements on [their website](https://yellowcard.io/) or in their FAQ regarding the management of private keys.
This leads us to conclude the wallet funds are likely under the control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
