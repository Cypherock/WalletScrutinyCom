**Update 2021-10-15**: Emanuel meanwhile
[was able to compile](https://github.com/btcontract/wallet/issues/63#issuecomment-924162388)
the app. Unfortunately there are remaining
[reproducibility issues](https://github.com/btcontract/wallet/issues/90).

## Old, updated Analysis

The provider
[stated here](https://github.com/btcontract/lnwallet/issues/20#issuecomment-902663980)
that {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.lightning.walletapp' verdict='true' %}
was discontinued and this is its successor.

Their website says:

> Simple Bitcoin Wallet (aka SBW) is an open-source, non-custodial, autonomous
  wallet for Android devices which can store, send and receive bitcoins.

This sounds good. What doesn't sound good are the many scam accusations and bug
complaints in the reviews on Play Store.

The
[link to f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.btcontract.wallet/) gives
hope to find a reproducible app though.
