This app is an interface for multiple exchanges:

> The CryptoFolio Appâ„¢ lets you trade instantly on suported exchanges without
  signing in to them every time.

meaning you don't own your keys (The keys to the exchanges maybe but not to your
bitcoins). The app security is therefore **not verifiable**.
