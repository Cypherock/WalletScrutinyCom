This app's description mainly focuses on trading and interest earning, features
usually associated with custodial offerings. Also their little paragraph on
security:

> With Industry-Leading Security Protocols, Two-Factor Authentication and Cold
  Wallet Storage, StormGain is a secure environment for Crypto Trading.

sounds more like a custodial offering with the "Cold Wallet Storage" in there.
We conclude the app is **not verifiable**.
