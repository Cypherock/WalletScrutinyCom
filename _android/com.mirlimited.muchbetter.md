As a payment app, it's almost certain that fiat and cryptocurrencies will be held in custody by a third party. 

There's also a use of identity verification which is usually a trait of custodial products. 

From the [FAQ:](https://support.muchbetter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007807928-Why-do-I-need-to-supply-identification-)

> As a regulated Financial Institution (e-money), we are obliged to identify our customers before offering certain services. A basic set of services and up to a sensible overall spending limit is available to all customer right after registration. Services such as sending money to other MuchBetter accounts, applying for a free, contactless MastercardÂ® or withdrawing money from your MuchBetter account require us to verify and validate your identity.

Verdict: This app is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable.**
