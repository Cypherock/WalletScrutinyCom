There is no evidence that this wallet supports BTC, the only 2 token supported from the website are USDX and LHT (Lighthouse token). <br>
The wallet may allow you to send it bitcoins to receive one of these tokens but there does not seem to be any bitcoins stored for the user.

Our verdict: This wallet does not support BTC.
