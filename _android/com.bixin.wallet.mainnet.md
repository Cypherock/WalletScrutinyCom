## The Site

[Article: What if OneKey goes out of business?](https://help.onekey.so/hc/en-us/articles/360002092496-What-if-OneKey-goes-out-of-business-)

> First and foremost, OneKey aspires to be a 100-year corporation!
>
> Second, even if OneKey goes bankrupt, your assets will be unaffected.
> 
> Your funds are stored on the blockchain, not on OneKey, and you can easily recover them by importing the mnemonic into a wallet that implements the BIP39 protocol.

## The App

We downloaded the app. 

The first options were to Create or Restore a wallet. If you select 'Create' you are then given the chance to choose different cryptocurrencies. You are then asked to backup the 12-word seed phrase. 

## Verdict

This app is evidently **self-custodial**. The repository only contains *one commit* from March 26, 2021 and the Google Play app has last been updated on June 29, 2021. Due to **missing sources,** we conclude that this app is **not verifiable.**
