This app appears to support Bitcoin:

> Use Bitcoin or Etherium to get started and deploy a masternode in seconds with
  the Flits app!

and self-custodial:

> You are the only one who controls the keys! Your crypto funds are 100% safely
  stored inside your phone!

but can we verify those claims?

On their website they brag with:

> **311 BTC**<br>
  Total wallet value

so they have quite some insight into their users' financial activity. Certainly
not great if you want more privacy. Together with the other claim:

> **33706**<br>
  Users

we get to an average balance of 9mBTC or $440US.

What we can not find though is their source code, so the app is **not verifiable**.
