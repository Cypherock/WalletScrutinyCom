Upon app installation users are made to write down the mnemonic phrase and pin.

Then users are made to choose between Counterparty or Ethereum blockchain. A third option is "I'm not sure". 

Selecting "I'm not sure" then brings you to the wallet page, which allows you to send or receive BTC.

Although it has a link to what it claims is its Github page for the wallet app, we have some qualms about it. 

First the last update was 5 years ago. 

Next, under the sub-folder "[app](https://github.com/IndieSquare/indiesquare-wallet/tree/master/app)", it describes Titanium alloys:

> Titanium Alloys are metals which contain a mixture of Titanium and other chemical elements. Such Alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures [1].  

Needless to say, this is unrelated to the app.
