## App Description

> Atari Smart Wallet enables you to manage and exchange your cryptocurrencies with Zero fees within the Atari Ecosystem. ATRI, ETH, USDT, BTC, LTC and BNB

## The Site

Much of the site's links to its social media pages and iOS app do not work.

## The App

We tried the app and it has no Bitcoin support. Clicking on the Bitcoin logo merely says "Comming Soon" (sic)

## Verdict

This app **does not have Bitcoin** support, at least not yet.
