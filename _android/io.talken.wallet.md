With this statement below from the providers [Play store description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.talken.wallet), it is clear that the user is not in control of the wallets private keys.

> Easy and secure wallet
> Easy wallet service without managing private keys and mnemonics.

Our Verdict: This "wallet" is custodial and therefor **not verifiable**
