This app appears to be a [CoPay](/copay/) clone given its app ID:
`com.polispay.copay`.

In the app's description we read:

> A unique wallet based on mnemonic phrases and public and private extended keys
> PolisPay wallet is impossible to hack.

which sounds like a claim to be non-custodial. Let's see if there is source code
somewhere ... nope. No mention of its source code or a repository.

This app is **not verifiable**.
