There is no statement regarding how private keys are managed in the play store description.
There is also no website representing this wallet, so further information is not available.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.

I do not like the findings of this wallet, it is very suspicious, no website, 2000+ 5 star reviews, no real review content of substance.
