It is necessary to distinguish this specific app from another related app from the same company. "Currency.com Investing" is not the same app as {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.currency.exchange.prod2' verdict='true' %}. Although, they link to each other via Google Play and in their respective domains, we'll treat them separately to avoid confusion. 

The app on Google Play references currency.com but has expcapital.com as its domain, when clicking on View Website.

We downloaded the app and after registering, we chose bitcoin as a currency and the app made a wallet address where it is possible to deposit after some account verification. 

Currency.com's [Deposits/Withdrawals Page](https://currency.com/deposits-withdrawals)

This is a **custodial** service and thus **not verifiable**.
