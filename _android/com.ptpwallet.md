There are no very explicit claims made about where the private keys are stored
but reading between the lines:

> PTPWallet has low transaction fees when withdrawing crypto coins like Bitcoin,
  Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum Cash, Ethereum Classic, and other digital
  assets.

"withdrawing crypto" only makes sense when you don't control the coins yet.

On the website there is no claims to the contrary and so we assume this is a
custodial offering and thus **not verifiable**.
