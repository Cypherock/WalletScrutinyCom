The Vauld website Help Center had an article "Security at Vauld" which covers a number of security risk.<br>
A statement of the management of the users "funds" makes it pretty clear the wallets private keys are in control of the provider.

> Our funds are managed through a multi signature system with the signatories being our co-founders.

Our verdict: This wallet is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
