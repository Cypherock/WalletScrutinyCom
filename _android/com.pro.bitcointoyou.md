The [Bitcointoyou website](https://www.bitcointoyou.com) has no statement regarding the management of private keys.
However being an exchange, it is highly likely that this is a custodial service with funds being in control of the provider.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
