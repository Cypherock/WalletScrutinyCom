**Update 2021-06-24**: This app is back on Google Play but given the app is the
one app we got most support requests about, from people that believe it's a
scam and given their latest comments remain scam accusations, we return to the
defunct verdict, assuming it doesn't work as intended. If you think that is a
mistake, please open an issue in our GitLab.

**Update 2021-01-15**: This app is not on Google Play anymore

Bcoiner - Free Bitcoin Wallet
does not share clear information it looks custodial and absent source code it is
definitely **not verifiable**.

Other observations
------------------

* The ratings are ... suspicious. Blocks of 5 star and 1 star claiming 5 star
  are fake and scam accusations.
