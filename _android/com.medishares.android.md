**Update:** This app is not available on Google Play anymore.

This wallet claims:

> - Secure your assets with Private Keys, Mnemonic Phrases, 2-Factor Authentication, and more

which kind of sort of sounds like a non-custodial wallet but also doesn't make
much sense. The private keys are what you want to protect. They are not a tool
to protect something.

[Their website](http://www.medishares.org/)
as per the dedicated data field on Google Play appears to not link
back to the wallet but in the description they mention a different website:
[mathwallet.org](https://mathwallet.org).

There we find no further claims about who holds the keys or public source code.

As they also promote a [Math Cloud Wallet](https://mathwallet.org/mathcloud/en/)
which is

> Convenient, safe and easy to use custodial wallet

we assume the wallet here is meant to be non-custodial but as it's closed source,
it is **not verifiable**.
