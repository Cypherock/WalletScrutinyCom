## App Description

As we can see in the description and title, this app is claiming to be an exchange.

> With Cryptocurrency Exchange mobile app, you can benefit from user-friendly trading tools, an order book that has high liquidity, an advanced mechanism for orders, and a variety of currency pairs. Buy Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies with your credit/debit card using the ‘Instant Buy’ button. Or, sell them off and top up your balance.

Even the screenshots claim that the app has "safe coin storage." Everything in its Google Play page appears to be trying to make this app look like a legitimate exchange.

## The App and Verdict

The actual app and website is just a link to Binance.

This app does not qualify as a wallet, and cannot hold your funds, as it only redirects to Binance. However, it has been dishonest about its features in Google Play. If this app had stated in the description that it was not a true exchange but a referral to one, then this app would have been classified as {% include verdictBadge.html verdict="nowallet" type='short' %}.  

Due to this app advertising features although **it is actually a referral link,**  we classify it as a **fake** app.
