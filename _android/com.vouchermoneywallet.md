This app claims to be owned by a  private corporation, NBsoft Cyprus Limited.

Its Google Play description reads:

> Redeem your Voucher Money vouchers to your wallet and generate new vouchers from your available VMUSD balance. Share voucher codes with friends and family or use it to pay for goods and services at participating retailers.<br><br>
Exchange your VMUSD balance for bitcoin to store in your wallet or make payments with later.

From its [bitcoin wallet](http://vouchermoney.com/bitcoin-wallet/) page we read:

> Vouchermoney Bitcoin wallet gives you full control over your bitcoins. This means no third party can use, freeze or lose your funds. You are however still responsible for security of your wallet.

We downloaded the app, registered and tried to create a bitcoin wallet. However, we were not able to find any functionalities allowing the app to send and receive bitcoins. Furthermore, instead of labeling it as a 'BTC' wallet, the label is **VMBTC**. We also saw a bitrefill menu option to the left. 

As for the app, it did not allow us to proceed further than a page asking for an App ID. The app merely shows an error:

> The App ID you have entered does not exist or public access has been disabled.

Many portions of the website seems to be incomplete. There are no social media accounts yet for Vouchermoney wallet. There is no Terms, User Agreement or other legal pages that are common in finance related apps. 

As such, we are forced to label this as **wip** until further information becomes available.
