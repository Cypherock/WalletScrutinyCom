## App Description

Cryptoneed is a multi-currency wallet that supports BTC, ETH, DOGE, USDT and many others.

## The App

Opening the app starts with "Create Wallet" or "Restore Wallet". The user is then given the option to choose between 12-words or 24-words. Then the user is asked to back up.

It is possible to send and receive Bitcoin from the app.

## Verdict

This is a self-custodial app. However, when we searched github for the appID 'com.silenca.cryptoneed', it [returned 0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.silenca.cryptoneed&ref=opensearch). There were also no links on their homepage pointing to github.
