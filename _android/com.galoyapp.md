**This wallet simply uses the tech that GaloyMoney has developed.** This product is *not officially affiliated* with GaloyMoney or the Bitcoin Beach project based in El Salvador.

Neither [the repository for the official open-source code](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy) nor the two official websites: [bitcoinbeach.com](https://bitcoinbeach.com) and [galoy.io](https://galoy.io) directly link to this Bitcoin Beach wallet.

Although GaloyMoney provides an infrastructure that allows people to launch custodial wallets **that does not mean that this app is trustworthy or safe to use.** 

> Lightning Wallet of the Bitcoin Beach community

This is the complete Google Play description. It's very short and unclear, with no mention of the original developers. It doesn't link to the official sites either and the app's developer is listed as "Galoy Inc."

We already know that the Bitcoin Beach Wallet uses GaloyMoney's tech AND claims to be the lightning wallet of the Bitcoin Beach community although it's not officially affiliated with either of those.  There's no mention of the providers. No faces. No names. At the very least, they could have clearly stated that they are simply using GaloyMoney's infrastructure. The app's description seems to be implying that it is *the official wallet* which is bound to mislead people. There's nothing there at all, so the providers will have no accountability if something goes wrong.

It's also pretty suspicious that the Privacy Policy links to [**galoy.flycricket.io/privacy.html**](https://galoy.flycricket.io/privacy.html) while the official site is [**galoy.io**](https://galoy.io).

It can never be fully emphasized how important it is to keep your coins in a secure wallet. *It's not worth it to lose your coins in a preventable scam.* 

Until a later update, as this is a **custodial** product we conclude it is **not verifiable**.
