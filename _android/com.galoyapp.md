> Lightning Wallet of the Bitcoin Beach community

It sounds like a BTC Wallet.

This is the app's full description. There is no direct link to the official website on the Play Store, but the email address and Privacy Policy are on [this site](https://galoy.io/).

galoy.io claims that this wallet is "shared custodial." It also provides a link to the [Github Repository](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/).

The README.md also provides some more information.

> Today’s wallets are typically on two ends of a spectrum: either custodial, managed by an exchange and often large, regulated corporations, or non-custodial, open source wallets.

> There is really not much in the middle: a custodial wallet that is open source and one that can be deployed for a local community. This would enable any tech-savvy person to deploy a union-bitcoin-bank for their own community, anywhere in the world. Galoy aims to bring this type of wallets to the bitcoin world.

> An open source bitcoin banking solution would have the benefits of pooling capital, and thus make the capital efficacy available to those users with the benefits of reduced fees like batch transactions, lightning channel management, no cost for “on us” transactions, and lower cost per user for maintaining online servers.
