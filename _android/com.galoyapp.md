**This wallet is not officially affiliated** with GaloyMoney or the Bitcoin Beach project based in El Salvador. It only uses the tech that Galoy has developed. 

The official open-source code for Galoy can be found in [this](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy) Github repository. Neither this repository nor the two official websites: [bitcoinbeach.com](https://bitcoinbeach.com) and [galoy.io](https://galoy.io) directly link to this Bitcoin Beach wallet.

GaloyMoney provides an infrastructure that allows people to launch custodial wallets. **But that does not mean that this app is secure or safe to use.**
The Google Play description does not mention that it is a fork, only stating the exact words below.
> Lightning Wallet of the Bitcoin Beach community

There is no mention of the providers. Even the app's developer is listed as "Galoy Inc."
It's also pretty suspicious that the Privacy Policy links to [**galoy.flycricket.io/privacy.html**](https://galoy.flycricket.io/privacy.html) while the official site is [**galoy.io**](https://galoy.io).

As we can assume this is a **custodial** wallet, it is very useful to know about who is holding your money. Who will you sue if the money goes poof? *It is not worth it to lose your coins in a scam.*
