> The CoinSpot app enables you to easily and safely manage all of your digital currencies in one place. Simply follow the markets, send & receive cryptocurrency, buy & sell all assets available on CoinSpot and easily access account facilities.

Sounds like an exchange.

> CoinSpot provides free managed wallets for all the coins listed on our platform! 

This means funds are under third-party custody. 

There are no mentions of private keys or self-custody, so we can assume this app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
