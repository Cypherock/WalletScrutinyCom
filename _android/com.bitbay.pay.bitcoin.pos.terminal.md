3. Confirm - the Point of Sale will generate a unique QR code for your transaction,
4. The customer then scans the code with their phone camera and confirms,

## Verdict

Although it mentions in the help section that [cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals can be made](https://zondaglobal.com/helpdesk/zonda-exchange/payments-and-withdrawals) on a wallet the platform provides, we cannot classify this service as **custodial** as it is not designed to be exclusively as a wallet. To use the app, a PoS device must be integrated by scanning a QR code. Thus, it **cannot really function as a wallet**.
