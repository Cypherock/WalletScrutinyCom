This wallet has no claim of being non-custodial in the app's description.

The one-star ratings over and over tell:

* there is a referral program, promising rewards
* the rewards are never reflected in the wallet
* funds cannot be sent to a different wallet
* SCAM

As a probably custodial app, it is **not verifiable**.
