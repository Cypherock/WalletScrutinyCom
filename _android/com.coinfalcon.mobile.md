> **State-of-the-Art Security**<br>
  CoinFalcon stores 98% of digital funds in an offline, secure wallet, while the
  rest is protected by high-grade security systems. We are committed to the
  highest safety standards both here on the app and our web platform.

which is clearly about a custodial offering.
