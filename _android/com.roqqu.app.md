It is somewhat obsecure weather this wallet can store bitcoins, but under their FAQ section on their website () 
it contains an article on how to [send and receive bitcoins](https://roqqu.com/knowledge/articles/send/how-to-send-and-receive-btc) with addresses and QR codes displayed.

Our verdict: This "wallet" is custodial, it does not provide public source code and therefore is **not verifiable**.
