BitPay is an old player in the space and is best known as a payment processor.
This app's description loses no word on who holds the keys to your coins but on
their website we can read:

> **Funds safety**<br>
  We keep all cryptocurrency funds on so called cold wallets. It means they are
  not connected to exchange servers directly.

which means this app is a custodial offering and therefore **not verifiable**.
