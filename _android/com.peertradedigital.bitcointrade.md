**This product and the accompanying official website is in Portuguese. The app may not have an English translation.**

> BitcoinTrade is the safest broker to invest in cryptocurrencies in Latin America. Founded in October 2017, the company is already among the national market leaders.

Google Translate was used here so something may be lost in translation. So this app refers to itself as a crypto broker in the description.

> Your eWallet is available on your smartphone 24 hours a day to trade, receive and transfer digital currencies. This way, it becomes easier to sell ethereum and follow the Ripple Quotation or other cryptocurrencies.

Presumably this means that this trading platform provides an exchange wallet?

The help center provides more info on the product.

> **[How do I verify and validate my personal account (individual)?](https://bitcointrade.zendesk.com/hc/pt-br/articles/360020639552-Como-fa%C3%A7o-para-verificar-e-validar-minha-conta-pessoal-pessoa-f%C3%ADsica-)**

> The first step is to register your name, email, cpf and password on our login screen. You will then receive an account validation email. After activating the email, the next step is to attach the images of the documents, in addition to the selfie with the identification document.

This is a form of KYC Verification, so it's likely that this app is custodial.

> **[Registration](https://www.bitcointrade.com.br/pt-BR/about/use-terms/#use-terms-heading-2)** 

> 7. Account verification: It is possible to operate on the website with verified or unverified account. Account verification takes place after approval of the documentation sent by the user through the platform. For Individuals, the documents required to verify the account are: 1) front and back of the RG or CNH; 2) proof of residence with expiration of up to 3 (three) previous months (be it electricity, water, internet, telephone or credit card bills); 3) a selfie holding a paper with the current date and “BitcoinTrade” written on it.


> Our platform has an automatic approval system, which can identify deposits and link them to the customers who made them. As a result, around 95% of deposits made on the platform are recognized within an hour . In specific cases, confirmation can take up to 1 business day.

Verdict: This app is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**

Additionally, [here is information](https://bitcointrade.zendesk.com/hc/pt-br/articles/360020894591-Quanto-tempo-demora-para-um-dep%C3%B3sito-em-reais-ser-aprovado-reconhecido-na-BitcoinTrade-) on how long it takes for deposits to be approved.
