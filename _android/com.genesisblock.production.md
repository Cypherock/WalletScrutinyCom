### Google Play Critical Reviews

According to the reviews, there's a waitlist for using the app.

       How do you spell useless: Genesis block You need a "golden ticket” to use the app or be 900000 in the waiting list. Talk of a dead app

## [Custody in Terms and Conditions](https://genesisblock.com/terms/account)

> Section 9. Digital assets you deposit with us will be stored in one or more unsegregated omnibus wallets, via one or more third-party custodians that we may elect in our sole discretion. Genesis Block currently custodies digital assets in Genesis Block’s name through an unsegregated account with BitGo Trust Company, a South Dakota chartered trust company and money service business, but may change or use additional custodians from time to time.

## The App

We installed the app. Instead of an option to register, we must first "request access."

The app then asks the user to "rank the following from most important to least important." These are the services Genesis Bank claims to offer:

> - Earn money
> - Borrow money
> - Debit card with BTC rewards
> - Digital banking

After sending an OTP to the provided email address, the platform requires you to enter your full name and Country of residence.

Once this is done, the app states that you are "in The Queue." It suggests users may play a game to jump spots, invite a friend, or request a golden ticket from a user already inside the app. You are not given access to the app beforehand.

## Verdict

Bitcoin related apps with lending services are usually **custodial** services. This makes their app, **not-verifiable.**
