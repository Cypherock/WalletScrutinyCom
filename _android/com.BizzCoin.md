### Google Play
From the description:

> BizzCoin Wallet is mnemonics based highly secured mobile wallet to store crypto assets. It currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. 

### App
Upon installing the app we found that users are provided with a 12-word mnemonic phrase upon creating a new wallet. Users are also able to import existing wallets by entering their mnemonics.

As the keys are on the side of the user, this app appears to be non-custodial. However, with no available source code, this app is **not verifiable.**
