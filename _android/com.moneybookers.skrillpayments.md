>The app empowers you to make online payments, send money to a friend or relative, and exchange cryptocurrencies.

From their terms of use:

>5.2.2 you will not have a personal cryptocurrency wallet with the Cryptocurrency Exchange

>The Supported Cryptocurrencies (and the fiat currency used to buy/sell them) are held in custody by a third party.

Based on this information, the app is custodial therefore not verifiable.
