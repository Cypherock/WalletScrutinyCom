> As a worldâ€™s leading digital asset trading platform, MEXC Exchange is committed to providing users safer, smarter and more convenient digital-asset trading and management services.

So it's an exchange. There's no word on self-custody or wallets though, but these exchanges usually have 'wallets' where users can trade BTC.

Due to this being a trading platform, we can assume the wallets are **custodial** therefore **not verifiable.**

Their website wasn't linked, but clicking the privacy policy will redirect you to the MEXC homepage.
