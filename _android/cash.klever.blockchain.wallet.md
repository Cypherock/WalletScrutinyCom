We found this app as [TronWallet](/com.tronwallet2/)'s listing at Google named
this app's website as its website, too. Or actually both apps claim
`www.tronwallet.me` was their website but that page only redirects to
`klever.io/en/` which in turn only points to this app not to TronWallet.

This app's description looks like a copy of TronWallet's description with the
same strong claims about being non-custodial and also without a link to the source
code on Google Play. On the website we can't find a link to their source
code neither.
[Searching GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22cash.klever.blockchain.wallet%22&type=Code)
doesn't yield relevant results neither and we conclude that this wallet is
closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
