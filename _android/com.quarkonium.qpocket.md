## App Description
From Google Play:

> QPocket is a secure mobile crypto wallet that supports Ethereum (ETH) , ERC20, Tron (TRX) tokens and their DApps. It aims to provide users with a simple, secure and fully functional portal to blockchain, which offers asset management, DApps, payment, exchanges and more functions.

QPocket can also support BTC wallets. It advertises being able to use one crypto wallet, with multiple crypto assets.

> Users can own Ethereum (ETH) , ERC20, Tron (TRX) accounts at the same time by creating only one **HD wallet address**. EOS, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), DASH, Ripple (XRP) and more to come!

## The Site
In the official website, QPocket says that it has the capability to support multiple HD wallets.

> Users can import mnemonics created in other wallets and have infinite sub wallets for free.

## The App
We tried the app. We were provided with the 12-word mnemonic and then asked to save it.

## Verdict
At the moment, before we can make a verdict on this app, we will wait for the code to be reviewed.
