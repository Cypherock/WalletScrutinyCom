## App Description

RWallet is a multi-currency non-custodial wallet that supports Bitcoin. It supports BTC, Bitcoin on RSK (RBTC), RIF Token (RIF), Dollar On Chain (DOC)

## The App

RWallet has three options:

- Create Basic Wallet
- Import Existing Wallet
- Add Read-only Wallet

Upon clicking "Create Basic Wallet", you are allowed to choose from Segwit or Legacy crypto address. After this, you are given access to the 12-word recovery phrase and asked to safeguard it.

You can send and receive like a normal wallet.

After confirming that the recovery phrase has a backup, the app asks you to set a PIN. This PIN must be entered to access the recovery phrase again.

## Verdict

We were able to find a related website even though RWallet's Google Page did not have a website listed. The contact email address had a domain of [iovlabs.org](https://iovlabs.org). We could not find any mention of RWallet's open-source nature on that website. However, searching for the appID 'com.rsk.rwallet.v2' brought us to what could possibly be [RWallet's GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rwallet/tree/dc448c87824f85b2705e36d09b743302e2b68fbf). Although this specific repository is not linked from the iovlabs.org, we feel that it could be relevant as it mentions a lot of related items. 

This app is for further verification.
