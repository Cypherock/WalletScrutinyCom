## The App

We tried the app. Some portions of it were in Japanese, although you can choose to receive your mnemonics in English. After the user is provided with a passphrase, the app asks you to set a password. You can add several other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin. It is possible to send and receive Bitcoin.

## Verdict

This app is self-custodial and for further verification.
