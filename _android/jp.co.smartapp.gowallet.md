This is currently an Ethereum and DApp focused app. 

They, however, indicate that they may support Bitcoin (BTC) in the future according to their Google Play description:

> â€» We can exchange only for ETH (ethereum) now, but will be able to exchange for Bitcoin (BTC) or NFT (erc721) soon in the near future.

Our verdict for this app is that it is **not a bitcoin wallet**.
