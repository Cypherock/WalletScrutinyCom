**Note: The app's logo and name bears a slight resemblance with another app:

## App Description

Bybt is, in its own words:

>  a cryptocurrency futures trading & information platform

It doesn't give much more information other than that. The website is meant to be a real-time market overview, and so is the app. There's no option to buy or trade BTC.

Furthermore, we see a disclaimer in the [Bybt User Agreement.](https://www.bybt.com/Disclaimer)

And this paragraph:

This app and website only provide information on the market. **This is not actually an exchange or wallet.**
