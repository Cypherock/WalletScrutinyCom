The Exmo [support FAQ](https://info.exmo.com/en/faq/) states under "Where are my EXMO funds kept?"

> Users cryptocurrency funds are stored on the exchangeâ€™s crypto wallets: cold and hot vaults.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
