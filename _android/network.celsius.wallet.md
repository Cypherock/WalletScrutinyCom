> Use our fully functioning & secure crypto wallet & crypto lending platform to
  transfer and withdraw your Ethereum, Bitcoin, and over 30 other
  cryptocurrencies, free.

sounds like also a Bitcoin wallet.

The focus on "lending platform" doesn't make us hope for non-custodial parts to
it though ...

And sure enough, nowhere on the website can we find about this app being
non-custodial. As a custodial app, it is **not verifiable**.
