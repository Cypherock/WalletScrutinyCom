From the Play Store description:

> Mixin Messenger is an open-source cryptocurrency wallet and signal protocol messenger, which supports almost all popular cryptocurrencies.

It supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Monero and thousands of other cryptocurrencies.

Also relevant:

> Mixin Messenger is built on Mixin Network, it's a PoS second layer solution for other blockchains. Mixin Network is a distributed second layer ledger, so you own your crypto assets. Because of this second layer, it's normal that you can't check your BTC address balance on a Bitcoin blockchain explorer.

More information about how its wallet functions can be found on this Zendesk article ["Guides for Wallet"](https://mixinmessenger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002664251-Guides-for-Wallet)

We emailed the Mixin development team on September 16, 2021, to verify whether they have custody of the private keys. We await their response.

The [repository](https://github.com/MixinNetwork) is linked in the description.

It appears that this wallet is **non-custodial** and that source-code is available. However, we still require additional verification before we can make a conclusive verdict on this app.
