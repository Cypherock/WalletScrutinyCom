This app appears to be an interface to a custodial trading platform. In the
Google Play description we read:

> Trust Through Transparency
> Uphold is fully reserved. Unlike banks, we donâ€™t loan out your money. To prove
  it, we publish our holdings in real time.

If they hold your money, you don't. As a custodial service this app is **not
verifiable**.
