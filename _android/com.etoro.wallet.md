The [etoro wallet FAQ site](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/etoro-wallet/) makes a statement that the private keys are held by the users wallet claiming to be non-custodial.
The FAQ question "Where is my private key? (eToro Wallet)" eToro’s answer...

> eToro secures your private key using market-leading security technologies. As per eToro’s security protocols, we do not share our wallet addresses, as doing so may expose our clients’ funds to potential attacks.

However such claims need to be verified and this wallets source code is nowhere to be found.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' claims to be non-custodial, however with no source code, this wallet therefore is **not verifiable**.
