## App Description

> Instead of sitting idle, you can make money through your mobile phone. **BTC Network provides you with a one-click solution that allows anyone anywhere to make money.**

BTC Network directly says that it is a cloud miner. It is not a standard wallet.

## The Site

From the official site's [whitepaper:](https://btcnetwork.in/white-paper/)

> Their Satoshi balance will be stored and safe on the BTC Network appâ€™s cloud server.

There's no word on how to withdraw or deposit. As this app is a cloud miner, we assume that the option to withdraw will only be available once the user has reached a certain threshold.


## The App

The app allows you to click a button to start mining. There is a wallet at the dashboard listing how many satoshis the user has earned, however there is no QR code, mnemonics or a public address. There's no option to deposit.

## Verdict

Due to holding your funds in the "cloud server," this app is classified as **custodial.**
