This Canada specific Money Service Business, FINTRAC regulated app or service, allows Canadian users to buy or sell Bitcoin. The app or service in its [Terms page](https://bitbuy.ca/en/terms) warns users that:

> The Bitbuy platform you keep your digital currency on, can get hacked and all digital currency can get lost and/or stolen.

They therefore [recommend](https://bitbuy.ca/en/resources/guide/bitbuy-cold-storage-guide-how-to-store-your-coins-on-your-own-cold-storage) withdrawing cryptocurrency assets on cold storage devices. 

Prior to purchasing Bitcoin, users are also mandated to pass KYC procedures.

We were not able to download the app due to location specific restrictions, but from the documentation and legal disclaimers, it is very apparent that this is a **custodial** service and therefore, its source code **cannot be verified**
