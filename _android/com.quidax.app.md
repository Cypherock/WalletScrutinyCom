From the play store description it clearly states the private keys are in control of the provider....

> Also, 98% of all cryptocurrencies on Quidax are stored in cold wallets (offline) with the remaining 2% protected in line with security best practises.

This means the exchange is holding the bitcoins on behalf of the user, hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
