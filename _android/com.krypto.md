The Krypto wallet has no statements on [their website](https://letskrypto.com) regarding the management of private keys.
this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are likely under the control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
