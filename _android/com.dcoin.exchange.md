From its Google Play description:

> Dcoin trading platform is the worldâ€™s first financial industry-standard digital assets and derivatives trading platform that mainly provides cryptocurrency trading services for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lite Coin , ripple,and etc.

We downloaded the app and BTC withdrawals necessitated further binding to a phone number and email address.

The app has a built in cryptocurrency exchange which allows users to trade, buy and sell cryptocurrencies with one another. 

With no features allowing access to private keys and no documentation, this app is determined to be **custodial** and thus cannot be verified.
