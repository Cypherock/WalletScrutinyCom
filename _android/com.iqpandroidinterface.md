## Verdict

The app is clearly self-custodial with the ability to send and receive BTC. Its release was fairly recent so even if we were not able to test it, we would assume that the advertised features will later on work as intended. However, searching for appID 'com.iqpandroidinterface' on Github, [yielded 0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.iqpandroidinterface&ref=opensearch). If there is **no source code** that is publicly available then this app **cannot be verified.**
