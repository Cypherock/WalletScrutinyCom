This app is also a

  from one wallet. Earn and spend crypto in the OpenBazaar marketplace.

so ... is it non-custodial?

The [FAQ](https://gethaven.app/faq/) is not explicit neither but

> **How is my data protected?**

and

kind of implicitly claim that your private keys are also on your device, only.
A more explicit claim would certainly be reassuring.

But how about source code? On their website we can't find any link to a

Also on GitHub [there is no clear candidate for a repository](https://github.com/search?q=%22io.ob1.nativeandroid%22).

We conclude the app is closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
