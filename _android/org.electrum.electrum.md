Version `4.1.5` appeared on Play Store. let's see if that is also reproducible.
As for us, that version is still not available, we again go with the direct
download from their website and check if that's the same as what Google
distributes later.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum
$ cd electrum/
$ git checkout 4.1.5
$ wget https://download.electrum.org/4.1.5/Electrum-4.1.5.0-arm64-v8a-release.apk
$ wget https://download.electrum.org/4.1.5/Electrum-4.1.5.0-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
```

... and now we are supposed to run `contrib/android/build.sh` which has 68 lines
of code and calls `contrib/build_tools_util.sh` with its 154 lines of code.

That's a bit too much as we want to automate reproducibility testing and don't
want to run "random" code on our infrastructure - with root privilege even. We
filed an
[issue to adjust the build instructions accordingly](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7417)
but it appears to be easy enough to build without running above scripts at all:

```
$ cp contrib/deterministic-build/requirements-build-android.txt contrib/android/
$ docker build -t electrum-android-builder-img contrib/android/
$ docker run -it --rm \
      --name electrum-android-builder-cont \
      --volume $PWD:/home/user/wspace/electrum \
      --volume $PWD/.buildozer/.gradle:/home/user/.gradle \
      --workdir /home/user/wspace/electrum electrum-android-builder-img \
      /bin/bash -c `./contrib/android/make_apk release-unsigned`
...

```

That looks good. After unzipping the two APKs from the download and the two
just built, the diffs look as follows:

```
$ unzip -d fromBuild32 dist/Electrum-4.1.5.0-armeabi-v7a-release-unsigned.apk 
$ unzip -d fromBuild64 dist/Electrum-4.1.5.0-arm64-v8a-release-unsigned.apk

And with the updated test script:

4.1.5
```

which is a full match except for the signature which is expected. Electrum
`4.1.5` is **reproducible**!
