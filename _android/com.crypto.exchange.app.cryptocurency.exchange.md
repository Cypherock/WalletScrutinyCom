⚠️ **Warning!** Despite its claims, this app is not a real cryptocurrency exchange app. It is a blatant ploy to receive affiliate commissions from binance. 

When you click on 'Visit Website' on Google Play, the domain listed is crypto-exchange.club. This domain redirects to binance.com with referral url =LDVC8GFU

When you download and open the app, it opens a binance signup form.

This is definitely **not a wallet.**
