This app is a POS solution aimed at Merchants receiving crypo currencies, the POS mobile app is listed on their website https://coingate.com/pos, however no mention of any source repository for it.
This mobile solution looks to work via an Api and can not send crypto currencies, hence it is not a wallet.
