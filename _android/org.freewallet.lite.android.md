**Update 2021-05-25**: This app is not on the Play Store anymore. The app's
website links to [this Freewallet](/android/mw.org.freewallet.app/) now.

**Update 2019-11-29**: This wallet shares no source code but was categorized as
too small, which makes it irrelevant for listings.

In their description they claim

> Keys are always kept in your phone and never sent outside your device.

so it's a non-custodial wallet.

Neither on Google Play nor on their website could we find a link to the source
code.

[Searching their application ID on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q="org.freewallet.lite.android")
was without results, too.

This wallet is **not verifiable**.
