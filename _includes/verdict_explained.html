{% assign notVerifiable = '<p>
  The app cannot be indenpendently verified. If the provider puts your funds at
  risk on purpose or by accident, you will probably not know about the issue
  before people start losing money. If the provider is more criminally inclined
  he might have collected all the backups of all the wallets, ready to be
  emptied at the press of a button. The app might have a formidable track record
  but out of distress or change in management turns out to be evil from some
  point on, with nobody outside ever knowing before it is too late.</p>' %}

<h2 id="verdictExplained">Verdict Explained</h2>
{% case page.verdict %}
  {% when "wip" %}
    <p>This app still needs to be evaluated. We only gathered name and logo and
    maybe some more details but we have not really looked much into it yet.</p>
  {% when "custodial" %}
    <p><strong>Not verifiable</strong>: Custodial</p>

    <p>This verdict means that the app might or might not be open source and maybe
    it is even possible to reproduce the build from the source code but as it is
    custodial, the provider already has exclusive control over the funds, so it
    is not a wallet where you would be in sole control of your funds.</p>
    {{ notVerifiable }}
  {% when "nowallet" %}
    <p>This appears to not be an app to send and receive bitcoins.</p>
  {% when "nosource" %}
    <p><strong>Not verifiable</strong>: No Open Source Code found</p>

    <p>This verdict means that we could not find any source to compile the app.
    Internally the company might do everything right but as we can't verify it,
    there is nothing protecting the user from an exit-scam where the provider
    releases an app that leaks the keys to the servers.</p>
    {{ notVerifiable }}
  {% when "nonverifiable" %}
    <p><strong>Not verifiable</strong>: The provided Open Source Code could not
    be verified to match the app released on Google Play</p>

    <p>This verdict means that the provider did provide source code but that we
    could not verify that this source code matches the released app. This might
    be due to the source being released later than the app or due to the
    provided instructions on how to compile the app not being sufficient or
    due to the provider excluding parts from the public source code. In any
    case, the result is a discrepancy between the app we can create and the app
    we can find on GooglePlay and any discrepancy might leak your backup to the
    server.</p>
    {{ notVerifiable }}
  {% when "verifiable" %}
    <p><strong>Verifiable</strong>: The provided Open Source Code matches the
    app released on Google Play</p>

    <p>The app can be indenpendently verified. If the provider puts your funds at
    risk on purpose or by accident, security researchers can see this if they care
    to look. It also means that inside the company engineers can verify that the
    release manager is releasing the app based on code known to all engineers on
    the team. A scammer would
    have to work under the potential eyes of security researchers. He would have
    to take more effort in hiding any exploit.</p>
    <p>"Verifiable" does not mean "verified". There is good reason to believe that
    there are by far not enough security researchers to investigate all the
    changes in verifiable apps.</p>
