This app appears to be an app interface for the Binance exchange and at first we
cannot find anything indicating that there is also a non-custodial feature to
this app.

> The Binance app is regularly updated to provide you with the most up to date features and to give you the best experience when trading on the binance crypto exchange platform. Whilst all funds are protected by SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users) so that you can be sure that all your digital assets are secure and safe in any situation, we are with you all the way to ensure you have the very best in customer service and security.

Doesn't sound like you control the keys.

Also Binance does provide a non-custodial wallet on Android which is
[Trustwallet](https://walletscrutiny.com/trust/) which happens to be closed
source.
