So ... they released a new version and we took the time to automate verification
in our
[test script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/test.sh).

That script came to this conclusion:

which is what we want to see for the verdict **verifiable**.

Unfortunately there is some recursive reasoning as the compilation depends on
what we extract from the apk. It would be nice if those parameters were not
necessary for the compilation to work. Also the huge docker image that needs to
be recreated for each build feels like an overkill and might raise other issues
once somebody actually does a code audit.
