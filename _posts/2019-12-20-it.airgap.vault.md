We found this app reviewing [AirGap Wallet](/it.airgap.wallet/). These two apps
work in concert. *AirGap Wallet* does the communication to the web and *AirGap
Vault* holds the private keys, ideally on a phone that doesn't have internet.
This is certainly an interesting approach.

> the private key is generated and securely stored on another device with the
  AirGap Vault app.

This claims to be a non-custodial app.

On the description there is no mention of Open Source but on the website there
is a link to [GitHub](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-wallet).

Let's see how far we get building this app, version `3.0.0`. The build
instructions explain how to run the app, not how to build the release version
and the actual build instructions are at the time of this writing only to be
found in
[the issue we opened with them](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-wallet/issues/18).

The new build instructions are also not without issues:

* Each app build requires building a new Docker image
* The Docker image is huge with its 6.24GB
* The Docker container is also persisted for subsequent extraction of the APK.
* We have to edit a versioned file (`config.xml`)
* We have to know a `BUILD_NR` (14555 for the current build) and don't
  understand yet where that is supposed to come from.

But as we have not yet established strict rules of how easy or "standard"
build instructions have to be, we go with it:

```
$ sed -i -e "s/version=\"0.0.0\"/version=\"3.0.0\"/g" config.xml
$ docker build -f build/android/Dockerfile -t airgap-vault --build-arg BUILD_NR="14555" --build-arg VERSION="3.0.0" .
$ docker run --name "airgap-vault-build" airgap-vault echo "container ran."
$ docker cp airgap-vault-build:/app/android-release-unsigned.apk airgap-vault-release-unsigned.apk
$ apktool d -o fromBuild airgap-vault-release-unsigned.apk 
$ diff --brief --recursive from*
Files fromBuild/apktool.yml and fromPlay/apktool.yml differ
Files fromBuild/original/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and fromPlay/original/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF differ
Only in fromPlay/original/META-INF: PAPERS.RSA
Only in fromPlay/original/META-INF: PAPERS.SF
```

`apktool.yml` is generated by apktool in the prior command. The other three files
are the expected missing signature.

Our verdict: This wallet is **verifiable**.
