The description on their Playstore listing gets straight to the point:

> Security is Lumi Walletâ€™s primary focus: private keys are kept exclusively on
your device.

But ... the paragraph continues to state:

> All funds are held in cold storage and you always remain the sole owner of
your cryptocurrency.

```
What is cold storage?
---------------------

"cold" in a wallet context means that the key is not on a web-connected device.
This could be your keys only existing on a piece of paper in form of 12 words
or on a hardware wallet.

As these approaches usually involve plugging the hardware wallet into a
connected device or restoring the 12 words on such a device, these solutions are
not suited for institutions.

Institutions actually take "cold" to a higher level by having one computer that
never is connected - that stays cold - and transactions are built on a "hot"
computer and transferred to the "cold" computer on a pen-drive for example, to
be signed and be carried back to the "hot" computer the same way.
```

So what is it? "your device" is pretty hot for being cold storage. Them using
cold storage would be custodial.

> Universal backup is possible due to the use of the HD wallet model - one
mnemonic phrase will restore all your token wallets.

This sounds good again.

> No need to provide any personal info.

This also is not typical for custodial apps, as these would be required by law
to collect personal data.

On their website there is no mention of an Android wallet. The "Mobile apps"
menu only contains two links that both redirect you to an iPhone app.

As their web-app also claims

> Wallet is created locally on your device

we assume for now that their use of "cold storage" is different than ours and
conclude they are probably not custodial but certainly closed source.

Our verdict: This app is **not verifiable**.
