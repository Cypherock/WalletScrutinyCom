**Update**: The
[issue about reproducibility](https://github.com/btcontract/lnwallet/issues/158)
was deleted just like every other issue on their GitHub, given our issue number
was 158 and the repository lists no issues at all.

Original Review:

This wallet claims to be non-custodial and on their website we find their source
code repository. Let's see how that goes ...

```
$ git clone git@github.com:btcontract/lnwallet.git
```

... 750MB download later ...

```
$ cd lnwallet
$ git tag
0.3-130
v0.3-129
```

there is no v0.4 and upon further investigation it turns out the project doesn't
update the `versionName` with every release, so it's more complicated to
determine which version we are dealing with on Google Play.

The latest `Bump version`
[commit](https://github.com/btcontract/lnwallet/commit/540354acf3bcbd502757b6c56956b443f7c8879b)
defines `getSupportActionBar setSubtitle "App version 0.4-142"` yet in my
install of the app I find "App version 0.4-141". When was that introduced? In
[this commit](https://github.com/btcontract/lnwallet/commit/91e65f52f0e75f37590fba47ab6f8e1d9f3d7c3f).
So ... we try to go from there:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight">$ git checkout 91e65f52f0e7
$ ./gradlew build

Which is a [known issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52204135/969478): The
gradle version is outdated. It should be 3.1 or above but is defined as

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.0'
```

So if there is a good reason for using an old gradle version (2.3 is from
[early 2015](https://gradle.org/releases/)), the team should explain that and
give clear build instructions.

At this point we give up and decide the wallet is **not easily verifiable**.
