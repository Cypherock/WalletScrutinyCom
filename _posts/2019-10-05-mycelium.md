[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet)
has its early roots in
[Bitcoin Spinner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miracleas.bitcoin_spinner),
a wallet originally
[announced in 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52674.0). while
Bitcoin Spinner's transaction history probably looks oddly familiar to Mycelium
users, it has come a long way since 2011 and is currently probably the most
feature rich Bitcoin wallet available.
