[BitPay – Secure Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.wallet)
links to its source code on their Google Play app description.

Copay is the first wallet here that uses [Angular](https://angular.io/) and we
are not most familiar with it. Our standard being "easily verifiable" means it
is on the wallet provider to also provide clear instructions on how to build the
app and the most straight forward way to very well define the environment would
be to explain it in code, using a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container
for example.

Copay does not advertise reproducibility for their builds and neither describe
well how to build the app at all and so we are stuck after running `npm install`
with this error message:


```
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! secp256k1@1.1.5 install: `node-gyp rebuild`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the secp256k1@1.1.5 install script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /home/chris/.npm/_logs/2019-11-09T21_53_17_873Z-debug.log
[ERROR] An error occurred while running subprocess cordova.

        cordova platform add android --save exited with exit code 1.

        Re-running this command with the --verbose flag may provide more information.
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE

```

which as it turns out,
[others are struggling with, too](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9037).

Therefore for now our verdict is that Copay **cannot be easily verified**.
