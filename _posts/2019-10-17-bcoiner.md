Bcoiner - Free Bitcoin Wallet
does not share clear information on whether or not it is custodial but in the
best case, it is **not verifiable** as there is no source code presented at
[their website](https://bcoiner.com/).

Other observations
------------------

* The ratings are ... suspicious. Blocks of 5 star and 1 star claiming 5 star are fake and scam accusations.
* No updates since January 2018
