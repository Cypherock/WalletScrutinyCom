This page was created by a script from the **appId** "co.nayuta.wallet" and public
information found
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.nayuta.wallet).

Probably an engineer will soon have a deeper look at this app.

This app was added because it came up searching the playstore for wallet apps.
