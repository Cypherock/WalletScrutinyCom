The description

> Wonâ€™t you rather trade and store your crypto assets on a platform you can
  trust? Busha is a Nigerian based crypto exchange that offers you all these and
  more.

sounds like it's an app to access an account on a custodial platform.

And there is nothing on the website indicating otherwise.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
