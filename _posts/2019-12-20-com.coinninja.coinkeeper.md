This wallet does not claim to be non-custodial - in fact it is custodial for
lightning but lines like this in their [FAQ](https://dropbit.app/faq.html#s2)
sound like it is non-custodial for normal Bitcoin:

> **I lost access to my wallet, and did not write down my Recovery Words. Can I get my wallet back?**<br>
> If you did not import your DropBit wallet on any other device and you did not
save a copy of your recovery words, you have lost access to your wallet. **This
is why it is critical to write down and store safely your recovery words.**

On the website they also link to their GitHub account and from there we found
"dropbit-android" to be the most promising sounding repository.

The application ID is correct but the version tells me there will be an issue
with building this app:

Their
[build.gradle](https://github.com/coinninjadev/dropbit-android/blob/master/app/build.gradle)
is full with `System.getenv()` statements which means to compile the app, these
values need to be provided on the build system and are not part of the project.

For the purpose of our verification it would probably be acceptable to have some
"secrets" be different in the diff, provided they are not obfuscated causing
a diff all over the place.

Looking at their tags in the search for the right version 3.2.0 we are not lucky
neither:

```
$ git tag
1.4.1
1.4.4
1.4.5
1.4.6
1.5.0
1.5.1
1.6.0
1.6.1
1.7.0
2.0.0
2.1.0
2.2.0
2.3.0
2.3.1
2.3.2
2.3.4
3.0
3.0.1
3.0.2
3.1.0
3.1.1
```

Given their last commit is
[Merge branch '3.1.1RC' into 'master' ](https://github.com/coinninjadev/dropbit-android/commit/d67d7c0b9cad27db94470231073c5d6cdda83cd0)
we have to assume that this wallet currently **can not be verified**.
