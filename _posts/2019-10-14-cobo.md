Cobo Wallet: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, XRP, XLM
is at least primarily a custodial wallet and might have a non-custodial feature,
too.
[The description](https://cobo.com/wallet) is not very clear about this part but as
there is no source code available, it cannot be checked anyway, which is why the
verdict has to be: this wallet **cannot be verified**.
