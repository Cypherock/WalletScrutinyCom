In their description they claim

> Keys are always kept in your phone and never sent outside your device.

so it's a non-custodial wallet.

Neither on Google Play nor on their website could we find a link to the source
code.

[Searching their application ID on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q="org.freewallet.lite.android")
was without results, too.

This wallet **cannot be verified**.
