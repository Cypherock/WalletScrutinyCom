In the description we read:
> Full Private Key Control - The wallet being decentralized means that Lunes
  does not have access to your cryptos, only you through the private key.

That sounds good.

Neither on Google Play nor on their website can we find anything about source
code. That's bad.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
