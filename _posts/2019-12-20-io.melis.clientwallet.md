On Google Play we find no claims of this wallet being non-custodial or open
source.

On their website they claim

> With Melis you have the complete control of your bitcoins and private keys

which probably means non-custodial. And

> Melis is open source, published on GitHub.

but the link only leads us to [this GitHub account](https://github.com/melis-wallet),
not to a GitHub repository. But lets
[search the appId there ...](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amelis-wallet+%22io.melis.clientwallet%22&type=Code) 
which gives us five hits in [this repository](https://github.com/melis-wallet/melis-cm-client).

So this is a Cordova app. The build instructions are there ... promising so far.
Time to get more hands-on ...

```
$ git clone https://github.com/melis-wallet/melis-cm-client
$ cd melis-cm-client/
$ git log

```

So this repository has a total of 5 commits with the latest being ahead of what
we would like to reproduce (1.5.40) and the prior one being much behind (1.1.0).

Lets see if the build instructions are helpful:

So we installed the prerequisites and `npm install` failed. Probably the
prerequisites need to be refined for this to work?

Anyway, for now this is **not verifiable**.
