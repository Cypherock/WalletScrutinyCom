The app description sounds more like a website description and thus like a
custodial tool where they talk about security:

> * Bitlish is a PCI DSS certified platform, i.e. your card transactions are maximum secure
> * Pass code to open the app
> * Two factor authentication
> * 3D-S card transaction confirmation
> * 24x7 antifraud monitoring
> * Bitlish is GDPR compliant, i.e. you control your personal data and can delete it anytime
> * Bitlish is recognised as the 6th most secure crypto exchange in the world

On their website's [wallet section](https://bitlish.com/en/mobile-wallet) we read:

> **What you get with our wallet?**
>
> Free cryptocurrency wallet address(-es) (or account) for every cryptocurrency we support

... that sounds awfully explicit about you not getting the keys for those
addresses or in other words they are a custodial service.

Our verdict: The wallet **cannot be verified**.
