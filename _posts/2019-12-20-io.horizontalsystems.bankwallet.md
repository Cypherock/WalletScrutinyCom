Our requests for change were heard quickly and we were promised the repository
would now provide version matching the app from Google Play from before:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android.git
$ cd unstoppable-wallet-android.git
$ git tag
0.1.0
0.1.1
0.10
0.11
0.2.0
0.3.0
0.4.0
0.5.0
0.6.1
0.6.2
0.6.3
0.7
0.7.0
0.8
0.9
0.9.1
1.0.0
```

`0.11` is the best match still, with no `0.11.0` as the app from Google Play.
Moreover the provider told us that issues were resolved, so we have to assume
the correct revision is the next and last one: `7bbaf88819`.

```
$ git checkout master
$ docker run -it --rm --volume $(pwd):/project --workdir /project mycelium-wallet
root@2d27fa0de9fb:/project# ./gradlew clean :app:assembleProductionMainnetRelease

This looks exactly like we want it to look. Only files differing are signature
and the analysis tool itself. This wallet is **verifiable**.
