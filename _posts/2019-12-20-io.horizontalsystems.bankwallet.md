The latest version on Google Play is "0.12.0". Lets see if that's verifiable:

**Update**: We claimed to have tested that version before and the provider
requested to verify the results as git tag `0.12` is supposed to match Google
version `0.12.0`. So, here we go again:

The file from Google was obtained from our Android phone after updating the
wallet. For convenience it was renamed to `wallet.apk` but `apktools` confirms
it is version `0.12.0`, a version which can't be found in the git repository,
which is why the test script errors out there: 

```
$ ./test.sh /tmp/wallet.apk

and here we take over with a manual review:

```

Just as in our last run there is 638 files that differ. That is not ok. This app
is **not verifiable**.

We apologize for a copy-paste error in the last review, where erroneously was a
mention of `0.11.0`. This happened because the script couldn't find the correct
revision, so the process was done manually, following the protocol from earlier
tests and the protocol was updated to reflect the latest changes. The apk file
name was not update in the process. Sorry.
