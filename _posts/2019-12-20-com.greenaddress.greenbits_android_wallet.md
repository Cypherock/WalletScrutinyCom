Here we test if version `3.3.0` is verifiable after Blockstream provided the
missing tag. See older reviews for more.

```
$ git tag | grep 3.3.0
release_3.3.0
$ git checkout release_3.3.0
HEAD is now at 820b797 increment to version 3.3.0
```

Turns out `820b797` is the commit we had guessed to be the 3.3.0 release due to
its commit message but had failed to verify it. Let's try again anyway for the
protocol:

```
$ cd green_android
$ git pull
$ git checkout $( git tag | grep 3.3.0 )
$ docker run -it --volume $PWD:/mnt --workdir /mnt --rm mycelium-wallet bash
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# yes | /opt/android-sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;29.0.2"
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# ./gradlew clean build -x test
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7m 51s
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# exit

That does not look good.

As discussed in our first review (see Older Reviews above), the build
instructions for using their Docker don't work and the review where verification
succeeded was done on a not well defined system (our laptop), so the failure to
verify the build now might be the result of the well defined system (mycelium-wallet
Docker image, which is basically ubuntu:18.04 + java + android) being different
from the prior system. Either way, clear build instructions that yield the
desired results are required.

Unfortunately our verdict remains **not verifiable** and we hope the company
provides the missing information to verify their build soon.
