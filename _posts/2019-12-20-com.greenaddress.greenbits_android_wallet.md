Here we test if version `3.3.0` also is verifiable. See older reviews for more.

We are still finding out how to best do and document things and as it turns out,
the first verification was done without Docker, which is a bit scary as it means
running potentially harmful commands. Also does it fail to fully document what
is required. So here we go again, this time within a Docker container where
things get executed:

```
$ cd green_android
$ git pull
$ git tag | grep 3.3.0
```

There is no such tag. Empty output.

```
$ git log
...
commit 820b79780ea9bc447f2794d4d34a64f5796a2d55
Author: Riccardo Casatta <riccardo@casatta.it>
Date:   Tue Dec 17 18:28:41 2019 +0100

    increment to version 3.3.0
```

We will try that one:

```
$ docker run -it --volume $PWD:/mnt --workdir /mnt --rm mycelium-wallet bash
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# yes | /opt/android-sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;29.0.2"
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# git checkout 820b79780ea9bc447f2794d4d34a64f5796a2d55
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# ./gradlew clean build -x test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3m 37s
```

This looks like the APK would be smaller had we installed some tool to achieve
that? That sounds potentially bad for deterministic builds. Anyway:

```
root@efae6adea0d1:/mnt# exit
$ apktool d -o fromGoogle Green\ 3.3.0\ \(com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet\).apk 
$ apktool d -o fromBuild app/build/outputs/apk/production/release/app-production-release-unsigned.apk 
$ diff --brief --recursive from*
Files fromBuild/apktool.yml and fromGoogle/apktool.yml differ

Files fromBuild/smali/com/blockstream/libgreenaddress/GDK.smali and fromGoogle/smali/com/blockstream/libgreenaddress/GDK.smali differ
```

That does not look good. There is also `production_21`, not sure what it is:

```
$ rm -rf fromBuild/
$ apktool d -o fromBuild app/build/outputs/apk/production_21/release/app-production_21-release-unsigned.apk 
$ diff --brief --recursive from* | wc -l
1202
```

1202 files differing is not good.

Unfortunately with the missing tag we fail to verify the build and have to revert
our prior verdict to **not verifiable**.
