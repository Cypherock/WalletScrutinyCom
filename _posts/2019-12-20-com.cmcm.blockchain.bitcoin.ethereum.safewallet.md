This wallet has not much information out there. On the one hand we read:

> SafeWallet is a decentralized wallet
> ⚠️ Why decentralized wallets like SafeWallet?
> Decentralized wallets are safer than centralized wallets or exchanges.

Ok? So ... is it non-custodial then? Sounds like it.

> ✅ Why SafeWallet?
> SafeWallet have equipped with a full suite of malware defense systems to kill
all known malware, and also a three-tiered defense system against unknown
viruses.

That sounds a lot like snake-oil salesman to us.

When we had a look, the last messages were advertising cloud mining, which often
are scams and should probably not be allowed in a wallet support chat.

All in all there are no strong claims about self-custody of the money and given
they explicitly do not support industry standards:

> 💯QR code-based user identification system: SafeWallet ID
> Back up easily by remembering three self-selected questions, instead of the
traditional backup mode of transcribing complex mnemonic phrases and private
keys on paper

Our verdict: this app is **not verifiable**.
