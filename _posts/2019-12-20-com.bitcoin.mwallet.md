**Update**: As it turns out, they organize their releases in branches and don't
use tags. At the current state of the project we would give them the benefit of
the doubt: For now it looks at least like open source but version tags are
missing!

"Bitcoin Wallet" by Bitcoin.com claims to be non-custodial:

> Our non-custodial wallet app lets nobody but you access the coins you own.

but can we verify that?

On the playstore description there is no word about it being open source. The
website links to Android, iPhone and
[other versions](https://github.com/bitcoin-portal/bitcoin-wallet-releases/releases)
where we find a "Source Code (zip)" but that contains only a two line text file.

Again on the website there is a link to [wallet](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/)
where we can't find a link to source code neither.

Searching GitHub for `com.bitcoin.mwallet` yields
[Bitcoin-com / Wallet](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/Wallet) as a good
candidate for an actual repository. A wallet with more than a million downloads
should probably make it easier to find its source code. But let's see if this is
it.

If you have an issue with this wallet, you are
[sent to Copay](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/Wallet/blob/235b2856d246eaa1ed891ef945184688270ac190/CONTRIBUTING.md#support)
which this appears to be a clone of, given "Copay" is found all over the place.

Given
[others can't find the latest code since half a year](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/Wallet/issues/555)
and tags run only up to `5.6` (with the current code using `5.9`):

```
$ git tag | grep ^5.
5.0-hotfix1
5.0-rc1
5.0-rc2
5.0-rc3
5.1-beta1
5.1-beta2
5.1-rc2
5.1-rc3
5.1-rc5
5.2-hotfix1
5.2-hotfix2
5.2-rc1
5.3-rc1
5.4-hotfix1
5.4-rc4
5.5-rc3
5.6-rc1
5.6-rc3
$ cat app-template/bitcoincom/appConfig.json | grep Version
  "fullVersion": "5.9-rc2",
  "androidVersion": "509001",
```

we give up our search and assume for now that the wallet went closed source,
given the apk released is using version `5.13.3`.

We are happy to update this website should the provider come around and clearly
offer an up to date source code.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
