Coinomi Wallet :: Bitcoin Ethereum Altcoins Tokens
claims to be non-custodial but we cannot find any source code on
[their GitHub page](https://github.com/coinomi/), so we **can't verify** any
claims.


Further observations
--------------------

There are people very convinced you should
[avoid Coinomi](https://avoid-coinomi.com) based on a supposedly now fixed issue
in that the wallet sent the backup phrase to a server api and also based on the
communication of said issue.
