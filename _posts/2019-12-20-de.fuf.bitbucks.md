This app appears to be a custodial service as per their description:

> The BitBucks Wallet enables instant payments with bitcoin. Users register at
  BitBucks just by entering their phone numbers followed by a validation code
  sended to them via sms.
> 
> Afterwards users can top-up their BitBucks account with bitcoin by using any
  other Bitcoin wallet. Every transaction within the BitBucks app, as well as
  the top-up of the account, are free of charge.

And from their website:

> **Pay safely and securely**
> 
> Your Bitcoin is multi-signature protected and will be stored in the safest
  wallets. Even if you lose your mobile phone, you will not lose your credit.

This is a custodial app.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
