Coinomi Wallet :: Bitcoin Ethereum Altcoins Tokens
claims to be non-custodial but we cannot find any source code on their
[official GitHub page](https://github.com/coinomi/).

Our verdict: This app is **not verifiable**.


Further observations
--------------------

In terms of security issues, Coinomi had the worst kind of bug that luckily did
not lead to known financial losses:
*The 12 word backup was being sent to a remote server.*

Apparently the issue was only in the desktop version of the software. If yo want
to learn more, read Coinomi's
[official statement](https://medium.com/coinomi/official-statement-on-spell-check-findings-547ca348676b)
or search the web for

third party interpretations of the issue.
