Ripio Bitcoin Wallet: the new digital economy
does not claim to be non-custodial and looks much like an interface for an
exchange but absent clear claims we can not definitely say it's custodial but
we can say it is not open source. Nowhere on Google Play or on
[their website](https://www.ripio.com/) did we find a link to the wallet's
source code.

Therefore: This wallet is **not verifiable**.
