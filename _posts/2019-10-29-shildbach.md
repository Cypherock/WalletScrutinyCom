Schildbach's
[Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet)
was the first mobile bitcoin wallet and the first in this series to claim to be
verifiable. On [its website](https://wallet.schildbach.de/) we read:

> Bitcoin Wallet builds reproducibly. The binary (APK) is verified by F-Droid
> for each release, and it can be verified by anyone else e.g. by using
> `fdroid build --server de.schildbach.wallet`.

As mentioned in our [first post](/first-post/), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)
was probably one of the earliest projects to work with
[reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds/?title=Deterministic,_Reproducible_Builds)
for Android.
F-Droid has an active community of free and open source ([FOSS](/tags/#foss))
developers
